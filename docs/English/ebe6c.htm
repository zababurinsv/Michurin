<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">The Phase of Ethnic Inertia</h4>
<b>
<i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The 'golden autumn' of civilization.</font></i></b> After people have
survived upheavals they want quiet, not advance. They have already learned to
understand that the individual who wants to display himself in all his
originality is most dangerous for neighbours. But the danger can be avoided if
the social imperative is changed. It is sufficient simply to invent or depict an
ideal bearer of the best stereotype of behaviour, even if it has never existed,
and to require everyone to copy it.</p>
<p>In the ancient world the cult of the king as god was created on that basis.
Alexander the Great laid the basis of this perception of the world when Egyptian
priests declared him son of the god Ammon. Alexander liked that, but his
generals categorically refused to accept such a version as insulting to
Alexander's parents, Philip and Olympias.</p>
<p>But the idea only died away for the time-being. It was revived under the
successors of the Diadochi, especially in Rome, after Augustus. Rulers began to
demand all the honours for themselves due to gods, which meant that the image of
the ruler, even not his individual qualities but what was associated with duty,
were deified. Rulers thus became examples for imitation obligatory for all.</p>
<p>The Romans well understood that scoundrels, murderers, and liars who, as
people, deserved perhaps the blow of a knife in the belly, ascended the throne,
but the principle of the 'divinity of the caesar' became an obligatory condition
of decorum and loyalty to the established order. And the memory of the bloody
centuries of the acme phase was so terrible that any guarantee of order seemed
desirable.</p>
<p>In modern times, in the seventeenth to nineteenth centuries, a similar
principle found embodiment in the image of the 'gentleman', an honest, educated
person, which it was proposed should be imitated as far as possible. Deviation
from the imitation was condemned, if not by law, by public opinion. Its pressure
was sufficient.</p>
<p>In the East it was proposed to follow the example of a certain honoured hero
of antiquity. In short, all manifestations of originality were persecuted for
the sake of an ideal.</p>
<p>But it proceeded slowly. For people who did not want to disown their own
originality, there remained the spheres of art and science, which seemed
innocuous. He who seized a sword in the sixteenth century sat at home and wrote
treatises in the eighteenth century, valuable if the author was talented, and
senseless if he were a graphomaniac. And since there were always more of the
latter, huge libraries were created filled with books there was no point in
reading. It is called 'growth of culture'.</p>
<p>A similar situation built up in the Far East, which entered the inertial
phase in the tenth century A.D. In China it was the Sung epoch, which left a
vast number of objects d'art, not of such genius as those that survived from the
Tang dynasty but made with even more virtuosity. In Tibet the monasteries were
filled with books translated, but more often rewritten from old originals.</p>
<p>Of course geniuses appeared on this background (thinkers, scholars, poets),
but there were not more of them than in the cruel acme phase. But they had good
pupils, and disciples, and their conceptions had resonance. For example, the 'yellow
faith' of the teacher Zonghawa (1355-1418) intellectually enriched not only
separate consortia or sects but whole peoples (Mongols, Oirats, and some
Tibetans). In Byzantine culture this role was played by monks of Mt. Athos (fourteenth
and fifteenth centuries), whose ideas, while not accepted in demoralized, doomed
Constantinople, found a response in Great Russia.</p>
<p>But enough examples. Clearly, the inertial phase of ethnogenesis is a fall in
the drive or vigour of the ethnic system, and a growth in the accumulation of
material and cultural values. Let me test my conclusion on a neutral indicator,
viz., the change in stereotype of behaviour at the level of the Romano-German
superethnos.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>From the world of Christianity to the civilized world. </font></i></b>It
would be surprising if such a grandiose phenomenon as change of stereotype of
behaviour on the scale of a superethnos had not yet been noted or described. No,
both has been done, though from an absolutely different position than mine, and
in another system of concepts and terms. It doesn't matter! The terms of any
account can always be translated into one's own. Direct observations do not lose
value through that.</p>
<p>Werner Sombart wrote his <i>Der Bourgeois. Zur Geistesgeschichte des
moderated Wirtschaftsmenschen</i> (On the Spiritual History of Modern Economic
Man) in which he set himself the aim of showing how 'pre-capitalist man', i.e. 'natural
man', was converted into the shallow, petty-bourgeois, Philistine person now
observed everywhere. Before the rise of capitalism, according to Sombart, in the
twelfth to fourteenth centuries, 'the starting point for economic activity was
man's need ... however much man spent, so much must he receive.' <a name="ebe6text39"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note39">[+39]</a>
And only a fool could accumulate more.</p>
<p>There were, however, two classes, the rich signori and the mass of the people.
But the difference between them was not so great. The signore, constantly
risking his life, received many goods, and then squandered them on sumptuous
hunts, feasts, and beautiful ladies. There was no point in saving money; he
would perish all the same in the next war, and if not, then in the following one.
Therefore, while you were alive and healthy enjoy yourself.</p>
<p>The peasant had as much land as he needed to feed himself and his family. The
craftsman, according to Sombart, had the common sense not to work more than was
necessary to earn a merry living. If these people had seen a Rockefeller they
would have considered him mad.</p>
<p>But mediaeval Europeans did not consider the possessors of silk gowns and
gold ornaments mad. They valued treasures and did not spare either their own or
others' lives for them. They valued ringing, fine gold and not money, which they
began to be attracted by only in the twelfth century. It was then that the 'passion
for profit' arose which had only been observed up to then among Jews. <a name="ebe6text40"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note40">[+40]</a>
Greed first gripped the Catholic clergy, then the burghers, and finally whole
countries, but not to equal degree, and in different variants. Sometimes it
pushed them to pillage overseas countries. Sometimes it was satisfied by trade
which was also risky. Another path to riches was 'filthy money-lending. Others
achieved their end by obtaining lucrative posts, and so on. But the guiding
stimulus of activity everywhere was an instinctive striving for enrichment that
had almost not been seen up to then.</p>
<p>One might suppose that greed arose with the development of opportunities to
satisfy it. Sombart rejected the thesis that 'the capitalist spirit was created
by capitalism itself. <a name="ebe6text41"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note41">[+41]</a> He also did not agree with Max Weber that there is a fink between Protestantism
and capitalism. Instead he saw the cause of the development of the capitalist
spirit ... in predispositions inherited from ancestors, <a name="ebe6text42"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note42">[+42]</a> i.e. he considered these propensities an inheritable attribute. Therefore there
are special 'bourgeois natures', which Sombart divided into 'entrepreneurial'
and 'middle class'. <a name="ebe6text43"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note43">[+43]</a>
The former were gallant adventurers, founders of capitalism, and the latter
dismal, moderate, thorough clerks whose mass and bulk filled the vacuum formed
after the death of their predecessors.</p>
<p>According to Sombart the 'predisposition' to capitalism is observable not
only at the level of the person or organism but also at the level of the ethnos.
That convinced him of the biological nature of this phenomenon. <a name="ebe6text44"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note44">[+44]</a></p>

<p>He classed Celts and Goths in the ethnoi 'with a weak capitalist
predisposition', and placed only the Iberians below them ('a completely
uncapitalist people') who were 'immune to the fascination felt by almost all
peoples for gold'. <a name="ebe6text45"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note45">[+45]</a></p>

<p>Ethnoi inclined to capitalism were divided into two types: 'hero folk' and 'trader
folk'. <a name="ebe6text46"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note46">[+46]</a>
Sombart put the Romans, Normans, Langobards, Saxons, and Franks among the first
(and so the English and French), and the Florentines, Scottish Lowlanders, and
Jews among the second, <a name="ebe6text47"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note47">[+47]</a><a HREF="http://web.archive.org/web/20031015025749/http://www.cossackweb.com/gumilev/ch6c.htm/l47"><u><font color="#0000ff">
</font></u></a>and also the Frisians, who, he said, 'were very early
on considered clever, slippery trading people'. <a name="ebe6text48"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note48">[+48]</a>
Sombart needed that in order to explain the mercenary mindedness of the Dutch
and Lowland Scots, because there is a suggestion that Lowland Scotland was
settled by, among others, Frisians. Sombart did not deal with the Slavs and
Greeks, seemingly not considering them, in contrast to the Jews, as European
peoples, which indicates that a superethnos rather than a geographical region
fell into his field of view. That makes his analysis interesting for my theme,
because he described, as a matter of fact, the transition from the acme phase to
the inertial phase. But considering peoples (ethnoi) as stable systems, and
subdivisions of races, Sombart had to explain the triumph of the 'petty-bourgeois
spirit' in Tuscany by an admixture of Etruscan 'blood', although the Etruscans
disappeared in the fourth century B.C., and the Florentines became
petty-bourgeois in the fifteenth century. That gap of 2 000 years already puts
one on one's guard and compels one to criticize the conception.</p>
<p>I suggest that Sombart's observations are true but his interpretation of them
unsatisfactory. The Iberians were the oldest layer of Europeans, and were
already in homeostasis at the time of the Romans. When one sees only the final
phase of ethnogenesis, one cannot judge the foregoing ones. The descendants of
the trading Etruscans are the Corsicans, who long ago lost the habits of their
forefathers, and still preferred the vendetta to trade in the nineteenth
century. I have written about the Celts above. The peoples Wed by Sombart as
traders all had one common attribute, a high degree of mixed breeding. Tuscany
lay on the road from the north to Rome. Across it passed, only after the tenth
century, Swabian Ghibellines, Angevin Guelphs, Spaniards, French, and Austrians.
And all sowed their gene fund among the Tuscan population. The Scottish Lowlands
were a zone of contact between Scots, Angles, Norse Vikings, and French barons,
who were planted there by English and Scottish kings because the borders were
restless and troubled. The lower reaches of the Rhine, the region of the
Frisians, were also a place of ethnic contact of a German, Roman, and Celtic
population. That is the sole attribute there is in common for all the 'trader
folk', but it is sufficient. One can add Southern Italy and Andalusia to their
number (which Sombart seemingly overlooked). The picture is not changed.</p>
<p>The difference between 'signori' and 'entrepreneurs' is not so great. Both
are people of vigour and zest, or drive, but in different modi. The former are
vain, the latter greedy, but these differences are not essential. What is
important is that both differ markedly from the petty bourgeois, clerks, and
real bearers of the 'capitalist spirit' which, in my view, is only an
impoverishment of the original creative zest that always arises during an
upsurge of drive. The 'petty bourgeois' condemn the 'signori' only because they
would like to be like them but cannot. <a name="ebe6text49"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note49">[+49]</a> They are the remnants of the creative soaring from which only the 'motive of
gain' remains for them, i.e. these are harmonious individuals, and even people
with subdrive.+ <a name="ebe6text50"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note50">[+50]</a> But it follows from this that we are faced with an ordinary entropic process
similar to the cooling of a hot gas that converts it into water and then into
ice; by that one can understand a state of homeostasis, the limit of any process
of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>And now let me put Sombart's observations into the schema of ethnogenesis
proposed above. In the ninth to eleventh centuries, when there was still no
'capitalist spirit' in Europe, there was also no active ethnic cross-breeding.
People lived in small ethnic groups that had been formed recently and were
protecting their originality. The fact that these newly born ethnoi consisted of
different racial components is of no significance. Their stereotypes of
behaviour were original. The tasks facing any one' ethnos were common for each
of its members. Drive was equally displayed in all strata of the population, as
a consequence of which the social states were fluid. Cowardly barons died, and
valiant villeins became either knights or free townsmen.</p>
<p>In the twelfth to fifteenth centuries there was a division. In the monolithic
ethnoi there was a complicating of social systems, a strengthening of the
monarchy, a waste of people of excess drive in the Crusades or in neighbouring
countries (the Hundred Years' War). And in zones of ethnic contact, 'trader
folk' appeared and grew rich. In the acme phase of the superethnos they lived
through the dissensions, enjoying the patronage of rulers. But gradually they
gathered strength and a second down turn began, to the inertial phase most
comfortable for them. It was similar to the cooling of steam, being converted
into water, at first hot, and then warmish.</p>
<p>As we already know, any change of aggregate state of a medium requires a big
expenditure of energy, in our case vigour or drive. Like any energy, drive
operates through a difference of potentials. This difference can arise either
from an impulse of drive, a natural phenomenon, or through close interethnic
contact in which the drive of one ethnos exceeds that of the other. The results
will be different: destruction of the natural landscape is recorded only in the
second variant, which I have demonstrated in a number of examples.</p>
<p>At the same time one must note that destruction in the anthropogenic
landscape is not by any means the rule, but a deplorable exception, fortunately
quite rare. If it were otherwise, then, after 50 000 years of the existence of
neoanthropes, the whole geobiocoenosis would have been destroyed and man himself
would have perished from hunger on an Earth made infertile. One must
consequently recognize that man's impact on the biosphere takes two opposing
directions, life-asserting and life-denying.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries 'cooling' of the Romano-German
superethnos proceeded rapidly. People of drive went to colonies and either died
there or returned sick. Harmonious individuals worked persistently at home, in
their fields, workshops, counting houses, and university lecture halls. They
never struggled for advantages, in practice onerous for them. And that is how
'trading people' √ Florentine money-changers, accommodating diplomats,
intriguers, and adventurers √ took the place freed by the people with drive.
They were foreign to the local ethnos but precisely because of that extremely
convenient for the monarchs, especially when they had no homelands.</p>
<p>And suddenly, luckily for them, Watt's steam engine was built and
subsequently technically improved. Towns grew and became polyethnic. People
began to live without ties with their ethnos, sometimes maintaining only remote
contact with it. And that is how the 'capitalist spirit' of Europeans developed,
so well described and abused by Sombart.</p>
<p>But why did that happen so easily? Only because, figuratively speaking, the
water cooled and froze. But when it is all turned to ice, i.e. when the phase of
obscuration sets in, the mercenary-minded tradesmen √ bacteria who eat away
the guts of the ethnos √ will perish, but a relict of the ethnos may remain.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Civilization and nature.</font></i></b> The conception of ethnogenesis that I
have proposed here would be subjective if we did not have a scale for comparing
it. But there is a scale; it is the history of the anthropogenic landscape, i.e.
the history of the interaction of technique and nature, through the mechanism
called an ethnos. In the phase described, people's attitude to their natural
environment changes sharply, once again through a lowering of the ethnic
system's drive.</p>
<p>However people with drive play havoc, the triumphant Philistine is a
phenomenon far more deadly as regards the nature that feeds us. In this phase no
one needs risk, because the necessary victories have been won, and reprisals
against the defenseless have begun. And who is more defenseless than the blessed
biosphere?</p>
<p>It was proclaimed that 'man is the king of nature', and he began to draw
tribute from it calmly and systematically. Cotton plantations covered the once
green hills of Dixieland, and in a certain, quite short time converted them into
sand dunes. The prairies were ploughed, the harvests were immense, but only for
a while; then dust storms blew, ruining gardens and crops in the eastern states
as far as the Atlantic. Industry developed and yielded immense profits, but the
Rhine, the Seine, and the Vistula became open sewers. The environs of
settlements and towns are polluted by industrial wastes, and poisonous chemicals
are dumped into rivers. No people with drive would ever have thought of such an
idea; it is impossible to explain anything to them. But does it need explaining?
For this is not the last phase of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>Ethnoi that bear on their shoulders the huge load of the culture accumulated
by their forefathers behave just the same. No technical advance in itself
entails progressive development without the involvement of people, although it
may be eroded by the constant action of destructive time. Egypt of the Old
Kingdom and Sumer had a higher level of cultivation than Egypt of the New
Kingdom and Assyria, which conquered Mesopotamia. It is seemingly a matter not
of things but of people, or rather of their stock of creative energy, i.e.
drive. Technique and art can therefore be regarded as indicators of ethnic
processes, as a kind of crystallization of the drive of past generations.</p>
<p>But perhaps I am overindulging in political history? For it is accepted to
consider that history and nature study are so remote from one another that it is
not justified to compare them. John Stewart Collis wrote in his <i>The Triumph
of the Tree</i>:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>No doubt Saint Paul was right to preach against the people of Antioch, and
  other prophets to lay their curse upon other cities. But they did the right
  thing for the wrong reasons. Those sins were not moral; they were not
  theological they were ecological. That pride and that luxury might have been a
  great deal more pronounced and yet no harm befallen them; the green fields
  would have continued to yield them increase and the limpid water to bring
  refreshment: that immorality and that impiety might have spread further and
  mounted higher, and still the strong towers would not have shaken and the
  massive walls would not have crumbled: but because they had been unfaithful to
  the land upon which they lived and which God had given them; because they had
  sinned against the laws of earth, and despoiled the forests, and loosed the
  floods, they were not forgiven, and all their works were swallowed in the sand. <a name="ebe6text51"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note51">[+51]</a></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Brilliant, but not true! The immorality and impiety in the cities were the
prelude to savage treatment of forests and fields, because the cause of the one
and the other was a lowering of the ethno-social system's level of drive. During
its preceding rise a characteristic feature had been severity toward itself and
neighbours. With lowering, 'philanthropy', forgiveness of weaknesses, and then
neglect of duty, and then crime, had been characteristic. And a habit of the
latter led ,o transfer of the 'right to outrage' from people to the landscape.
An ethnos' level of morality is the same phenomenon of the natural process of
ethnogenesis as predatory destruction of living nature. Because we have caught
the link, we would have been able to write the history of the anthropogenic
landscape, i.e. that deformed by man; because the meagerness of the direct
descriptions of resource-use in old authors can be supplemented by descriptions
of the moral standard and political collisions of the epoch studied. It is the
dynamics of the described relationship that is the subject-matter of ethnology,
the science of man's place in the biosphere.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact I have described the manifestation of a micro-mutation
that can be characterized as restoration of equilibrium disturbed by an impulse
of drive. The latter is reflected in the nature of a region no less than in
people that inhabited it. A surplus of energy leads to the development of new
needs and consequently to a reorganization and restructuring of the enclosing
terrain. I cited examples of this above; I now need to generalize them and
determine their trend.</p>
<p>As a rule a striving for improvement and provision of amenities is
characteristic of the first phase. An ethnos that is beginning to live does I
not imagine that an end awaits it also. And if some such idea had entered
anyone's head, no one would have wanted to listen to him. There is therefore a
desire to build forever, sparing no efforts. The riches of nature still seem
inexhaustible, and the job is to arrange unhampered winning of them. Sometimes
that leads to rapacity, but the strict order established and maintained by the
social system limits the initiative of private persons. Indeed, if the English
kings and their sheriffs had not introduced cruel laws against poachers, who
were called 'Robin Hoods' in the Middle Ages, there would have been not only not
a single deer left in England, but most likely not a single unfelled tree and
untrampled meadow. Perhaps it is better to admire not the heroes of English folk
ballads but their enemies, although both were bearers of mounting drive which
the killed animals, alas, lacked. For them the Hundred Years' War, which cost
many human lives but postponed death of the nature of Old England and La Belle
trance, was a good thing.</p>
<p>Such collisions have occurred many times, but the biosphere found a way out
of the impasse. Nature sometimes changes more quickly than history.</p>
<p>As I have already said, the process of the obscuration of Western Europe was
interrupted by an impulse of drive in the ninth century, but the wounds
inflicted on the biosphere then were not healed. In Gaul and Britannia, because
of heightened humidity, the forests and meadows were restored; in Italy and
Andalusia lemon and orange groves were grown, but in dry Northern Africa the
desert encroached. Whereas the Roman cavalry had obtained horses in the second
century from the countless herds pastured on the southern slopes of the Atlas,
in the eighth century the Arabs had begun to raise camels there. There was no
change of climatic conditions there because this was a zone of a stable
anticyclone, the Azores anticyclone. But it was impossible in those natural
conditions to restore the thin layer of humus in a few centuries. From the
second century B.C. to the fourth century A.D. the Romans had systematically
driven the Numidians, the ancestors of the Tuaregs, south. The latter moved away
with their herds, which gradually converted the dry steppe into the stony desert
of the Sahara. And at the eastern end of Eurasia the Chinese played the role of
the Romans, pressing the Hunni northward and converting the wooded slopes of the
Yinshan into the boundary of the stony Gobi desert, and the Ordos steppe into a
chain of sand dunes. There, it is true, the anthropogenic processes were
combined with the heterochronism of heightened moisture in the and and humid
zones, but it is easy to make allowance for that phenomenon to be sure that it
does not alter the conclusion.</p>
<p>There is a suggestion that natural processes √ droughts and floods √ are
as devastating for the nature of a region as the activity of man armed with the
technique of his time. But it is not so! Natural processes create reversible
changes. The repeated parching of the Great Steppe in Eurasia, for example,
caused a shifting of the dry steppe and semi-desert northward and southward from
the stony Gobi. But the subsequent humidification led to an opposite process;
the desert was overgrown by steppe grasses, and the forest encroached on the
steppe. And, parallel with that, the anthropocoenoses were restored √ the
nomads migrated with their herds 'for grass and water'.</p>
<p>But ethnogenesis is a natural process; consequently it should not, of itself,
create irreversible changes in the biosphere; and if it does, then obviously
some other factor is involved. What? Let us look.</p>
<p>In the Great Steppe ethnogenesis began three times in the historical period:
in the fifth and fourth centuries B.C. with the Hunni; in the fifth and sixth
centuries A.D. with the Turks and Uighurs; and in the twelfth century with the
Mongols and, in the Sungari taiga alongside, the Manchus. All these regenerated
ethnoi were descendants of aborigines, their predecessors. They did not expend
their surplus of drive on changing nature, because they love their land, but on
creating original political systems (the Hunnic clan power, the 'Eternal Ehl',
the Mongol ulus), and on campaigns against China and Iran. In that aspect the
nomads were like the By╜zantines. And it was not by chance that both are
regarded, from a standpoint of Eurocentrism, as 'second-rate' or 'defective',
although, from the angle of the need to protect the environment, the Europeans
and the Chinese should have learned from the Turks and Mongols.</p>
<p>But the worst in the phase of civilization is the stimulus of unnatural
migrations, or rather the resettlement of whole populations from a natural to an
anthropogenic landscape, i.e. into towns. Although each town, irrespective of
its size, exists at the expense of natural resources, it accumulates such a
great technical base within it that newcomers from quite dissimilar countries
can five in it. They are able to feed themselves in the urbanistic landscape,
for example, through exploitation of the aborigines who created and maintained
this artificial landscape. The most tragic thing in this collision is that the
migrants set up a feedback with the aborigines. They begin to teach them, to
introduce technical improvements suitable for the native terrain of the migrants
but not for the countries to which they have been mechanically transferred. This
projection is sometimes remediable; and sometimes flourishing countries are even
converted not into deserts but into badlands where the destructive effect of
technique is irreversible.</p>
<p>Such a fate overtook Mesopotamia as a consequence of the calamities of
historical fate. There the Sumerians turned the marshes into an Eden, and the
Semitic Akkadians built a town called 'The Gateway of God' (Bab-elom) or
Babylon. Why are there only ruins on its site now?</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Who destroyed Babylon?</font></i></b> It seems improbable that a city that
was the cultural and economic centre of the Near East for 1 500 years, perished
for no fundamental reasons. So what were they? And what was the mechanism of
their action? There is no answer in the literatures.</p>
<p>This great city was founded by the Amorites in the nineteenth century B.C.
and conquered by the Assyrians in the seventh century B.C. The conquest was
bloody, uprisings were put down brutally. Neighbours joined in the war (Elamites
and Chaldeans). The Chaldeans, a tribe of eastern Arabia, overthrew Assyria in
612 B.C. and became the masters of Babylon, whose population was as much as a
million, but included very few descendants of the ancient Babylonians. <a name="ebe6text52"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note52">[+52]</a> The culture and economy of the city outlived its founders, and the system, with
a new ethnic replenishment, continued to function. Despite all the bloodshed,
the stable anthropogenic landscape was not destroyed until the sixth century
B.C.</p>
<p>The economy of Babylon was based on a system of irrigating Mesopotamia, the
surplus water being drained into the sea via the Tigris. That was rational,
since the waters of the Euphrates and Tigris carried much suspended matter from
the Armenian uplands during floods, and choking of the fertile sod by gravel and
sand was undesirable. But in 582 B.C. Nebuchadnezzar concluded peace with Egypt
by marrying Queen Nikokerti (Nitocris), who subsequently passed to his successor
Nabonidas. Along with the Queen arrived her suite of educated Egyptians.
Nikokerti suggested to her husband, seemingly not without consulting her closest
advisors, to dig a new canal and increase the irrigated area. The King of the
Chaldeans adopted the Egyptian Queen's plan, and in the 560s the Pallukat canal
was dug, which began above Babylon and irrigated a vast area of land beyond the
river flood plains. <a name="ebe6text53"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note53">[+53]</a> What happened as a result?</p>
<p>The Euphrates began to flow more slowly, and the alluvium settled in the
irrigation canals. That increased the outlay of labour on maintaining the
irrigation network in its old state. The water from the Pallukat, which passed
across dry territories, caused salting of the soil. Farming ceased to be
profitable, but the process dragged on for a long time. In 324 B.C. Babylon was
still such a big city that the romantic Alexander the Great wanted to make it
his capital. But the more sober Seleucus Nicator, who gained possession of
Babylon in 312 B.C., preferred Seleucia on the Tigris and Antioch on the Orontes
to it. Babylon was deserted, and in 129 B.C. became the booty of the Parthians.
At the beginning of our era it was in ruins, in which a small settlement of
Judeans made their quarters. Then it disappeared.</p>
<p>But could one capricious queen really ruin a huge city and a flourishing
country? Obviously her role was not decisive. For if the king in Babylon had
been a local resident he would either have understood himself what devastating
consequences an ill-considered measure would have or he would have consulted
fellow-countrymen and have found capable people among them. But the king was a
Chaldean, his army consisted of Arabs, his counselors were Jews, and none of
them even bothered about problems of the geography of the country, conquered and
bled white. The Egyptian engineers mechanically transferred their techniques of
land improvement from the Nile to the Euphrates. The Nile carried fertile silt
during its flood, and the sand of the Libyan desert would drain away any
quantity of water, so that there was no danger of salting of the soil in Egypt.
The most dangerous thing was not even a mistake but the failure to pose the
problem where it should have been posed. For the inhabitants of Babylon, who had
replaced the Babylonians killed in war and carried off and dispersed, everything
seemed so clear that they didn't even want to think about it. But the
consequences of the next 'victory over nature' killed their descendants. That is
the difference between the 'geography of population' and ethnology. Bare
statistics figure in the former, but in the latter the problem of the relation
between an ethnos and the terrain in the different phases of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>The consequences of land improvement in Mesopotamia could not be corrected,
although attempts were made. In the seventh to ninth centuries A.D. the Arabs
had vast amounts of cheap labour at their disposal. They obtained Negro slaves
from Zandj (Zanzibar) whom they called Zindji. They forced these slaves to
gather up salt crystals in baskets in the environs of Babylon. The idea of
improving the soil that way was impractical, because the fine crystals were not
visible to the naked eye. And the work was ghastly, murderous in fact √ under
the scorching sun, with hands eaten away by the salt, and without hope of rest!</p>
<p>The desperate Blacks rose in revolt. The uprising lasted from A.D. 869 to 892
and ended, as was to be expected, in the death of all these unfortunate people.
But, furthermore, having sacrificed their own lives, which no longer gladdened
them, the Zindji destroyed the Baghdad Caliphate, because the vice-regents of
Egypt and Khorasan broke away from Baghdad, the bandit Ya'qub Saffar reached the
capital's walls, and the sectarians of Bahrein, the Karmathians, achieved
independence. That happened because all the Caliph's forces had been thrown
against the Zindji, and all his funds were needed to hire Turkomans to reinforce
the depleted army.</p>
<p>The Turkomans, warlike steppe dwellers, having seen that they were the sole
real force in Baghdad, began to change the Caliphs to suit themselves and to
suppress the indignation of their employers, the Arabs, by force. They were only
expelled with the help of hillmen, the Buidi, Shi'ites, who were enemies of
everything Arab, and who made the Caliph their puppet.</p>
<p>That was the price of the second attempt at land improvement and water
conservancy, ill-considered, and as irresponsible as the first.</p>
<p>But one must not think that any improvement of the soil is disastrous. It
only becomes so when it is not thought out, the locality is not studied, and the
consequences not allowed for. And that happened in antiquity when outsiders and
newcomers took charge. They had no time to study, but had to act immediately -
and see the results! But when an ethnos is in charge that constitutes part of
the surrounding terrain, it works in unison with the natural processes and
creates a stable biocoenosis in which there are ecological niches for plants,
animals, and people. That usually happens in the early phases of ethnogeneses,
because they are natural processes that are blended into the natural forming of
Earth's relief envelope.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>What is a ▒decline of culture'?</font></i></b> I have been drawing
attention to cruel, sombre eras, poor in remains of objects d'art, and that is
not by chance. The beautiful eras, rich in masterpieces, have been described
many times, and there is no point in repeating the descriptions. It is more to
the point to bring out and explain why the bright periods in the history of
culture are succeeded by dark ones.</p>
<p>Thinking people in the Middle Ages sincerely believed that they lived in a
time of decline, which was expressed in a permanent loss of the heritage of
antiquity (the Roman Empire and apostolic Christianity). Only in the fifteenth
century did that feeling disappear, as a consequence of which that age is called
the Renaissance.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Chinese held the same ideas, grieving for the culture of the
Han dynasty, and Persians, lauding their history, and the Arab Bedouins who
opposed the teaching of the Biblical prophets Adam, Noah, Moses, and included
among them Kings David and Solomon, to orthodox Islam.</p>
<p>There is no point in arguing about the truth of these convictions. They were
rooted in the feeling of the time, which was in itself a fact; and if it was a
global feeling then it is a historical fact. And if that is so, then it can and
should be explained scientifically.</p>
<p>But first I must ask what was in decline (or in advance). There are rises and
falls in ethnic processes and in the history of culture, but they do not
coincide with one another in phase. That is not accidental. An outburst or
explosion of drive inspiring ethnogenesis is as a rule lethal for and
destructive of the preceding culture. The old Christians smashed masterpieces of
antique sculpture; the early Goths, Vandals, and Franks burned towns and cities
with magnificent memorials of architecture; the Arabs destroyed the libraries of
Alexandria and Ctesiphon, and plastered over the frescoes of the cathedrals of
Cordoba. Art suffered terrible, irreplaceable losses, but that cannot be called
a decline, because the creative impulse, as such, was respected and only the
cultural dominant was changed.</p>
<p>On the contrary, however, the classical era of decline, the Roman Empire of
the second to fourth centuries A.D., is characterized by an increase in the
production of statues and frescoes, the building of temples and theatres, and
the erection of triumphal arches. But a lowering of aesthetics standards and of
quality was characteristic then, as I have said. The depictions of emperors were
conventional, and the busts of matrons were not expressive, because both were
tributes to the requirements of propriety and decorum as it was then understood.
Things were even worse with architecture. In order to erect Constantine's
triumphal arch in time, Trajan's arch was dismantled. That was no longer
craftsmanship but simply hack-work. Roman tenement houses were built so badly
that they often collapsed, burying the residents under their ruins. Rome had
ceased to five creatively before the Goth and Vandal devastations.</p>
<p>Had it indeed? For even in those cruel centuries there were authors of
immortal works: Lucian of Samosata, Ammianus Marcellinus, Sidonius Apollinaris,
not to mention the pleiad of Christian philosophers and the Neoplatonists close
in spirit to the Christians.</p>
<p>Yes, it was so, but remember that readers became fewer and fewer. Sidonius
Apollinaris complained bitterly of spiritual loneliness. The philosophers
Hypatia and Proclus lived alone and abandoned. Her disciples did not even defend
Hypatia from the Alexandrian mob. One can find bits and pieces of late statues
of a high standard, but they are insignificant in number compared with the
hack-work. That lowering of taste and substitution of the eclectic for style was
a real decline in art. But whether or not it was combined with catastrophic
destructions it was a detail of the historical processes and ethnic migrations.</p>
<p>So it was everywhere. In Byzantium the fourth-century poet John Chrysostom
came out as a rival of the almighty empress, and after his death was honoured as
a saint. And in the eleventh century all influence was concentrated in the hands
of the assembly (of top officials) which destroyed the hero-defenders of the
homeland, and there were no poets at all.</p>
<p>In the Arab Caliphate scholars were respected, and memorials of architecture
were not destroyed, but the <i>shuubiyya</i>, the creative interpretation of the
Koran, gave way to dogmatic pedantry. The Sung dynasty dealt similarly with
intellectual diversity in China, where all religions were banned, and only
Confucianism was tolerated. Decline of culture is obviously a general process.</p>
<p>Now let me pass to a summing up.</p>
<p>In the phase of ethnic inertia capacity to extend area is reduced and a time
of affecting the landscape of one's own country sets in. The technosphere grows,
i.e. the quantity of needed and unneeded buildings, articles, monuments, and
utensils increases, obviously at the expense of natural resources. Some of thew
changes are relatively harmless distortions of nature (irrigation ditches,
monoculture fields, vast herds of cattle). Left without attention they will be
restored to the natural geobiocoenoses. But where natural materials are confined
within the shackles of strict forms, self-development is prevented, being
replaced by slow but steady destruction, which is often irreversible. Only
archaeologists need such ruins. They study the traces of fading, not flourishing
ethnoi, that leave to the ages shards of vessels made of fired clay, fragments
of Babylonian tablets with cuneiform writing, pyramids, and the foundation of
the Baalbek temple, ruins of mediaeval castles, and of Mayan temples in the
jungles of Yucatan. The biosphere is capable of feeding people, but is not in a
position to satisfy their striving to cover the planet's surface with rubbish
removed from biocoenoses' cycle of conversion. In this phase, an ethnos, like
Anthaeus, loses touch with the soil, i.e. with life, and inevitable decline sets
in. The picture of this decline is deceptive. It wears a mask of well-being and
prosperity, which seem eternal to contemporaries because they cherish illusions
of inexhaustible natural wealth., But that is a consoling self-deception that is
dissipated after the last, and this time fatal, down turn sets in.</p>
<p>The last phase of ethnogenesis is destructive. The members of an ethnos who
are incapable (by the law of the irreversibility of evolution) of getting back
into contact with the biosphere, pass to despoliation and rapacity, but that
does not save them. Demographic decline begins, after which peripheral subethnoi
remain, minimally linked with the main line of ethnogenesis. They either
vegetate, as relicts, or create new ethnoi with different behavioural dominants.
Then the process is revived, of course, if there is another impulse of drive.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">The Phase of Obscuration</p>
<i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The 'twilight' of an ethnos.</font></i></b> A distinguishing feature of
'civilization' is reduction of the active element and full contentment of the
emotionally passive and hard-working population. But a third variant should also
be taken into account, viz., the existence of people who are neither
constructive nor hard-working, are emotionally and mentally defective, but who
possess heightened demands on fife. In heroic ages of growth and
self-manifestation these individuals have few chances of surviving. They are bad
soldiers, good-for-nothing workers, and the path of crime quickly leads, in
rigorous times, to the scaffold. But in the easy times of civilization, with a
general material abundance, there is an extra piece of bread and a woman for
everyone. 'Life-lovers' begin to multiply without limit and, since they are
creatures of a new mould, they create their own imperative, viz., 'be like us',
i.e. do not aspire to anything that cannot be eaten or drunk. Any growth becomes
an odiose phenomenon. The industrious and diligent are ridiculed, and
intellectual pleasures arouse fury and frenzy In art there is a decline in
style, in science original work is ousted by compilations, corruption becomes
the rule in public affairs, in military affairs soldiers impose their will on
officers and generals, threatening mutiny. Everything is for sale; no one can be
trusted, and a ruler must, in order to govern, employ the tactics of a robber
baron √ suspect rivals, and track them down and kill them.</p>
<p>The order established in this stage, which it would be correct to call
'obscuration', cannot in any way be considered democratic. In it, as in
preceding stages, groups predominate; only the principle of their selection is
different, and negative. Capabilities are not valued, but rather their absence,
ignorance and not education, unscrupulousness and not; firmness of opinion. Far
from every Philistine is capable of meeting these requirements and the majority
of the people therefore prove defective from the standpoint of the new
imperative and consequently unequal. But there is then retribution, because the
life-lovers only know how to live parasitically off the fat of the body of the
people overfed during 'civilization'. They themselves can neither create nor
preserve. They corrode the body of the people, like cancer cells corrode the
human organism, but having won, i.e. having killed the rival, they themselves
perish.</p>
<p>Other qualities than those so carefully cultivated are needed, in fact, in
order to protect the family and bring up children. Otherwise the children will
make short work of their parents as soon as it is convenient for them. Thus,
after obscuration begins to triumph its bearers disappear like smoke, and there
remain descendants of the original bearers of the static state, who have
survived all the scrapes, and who begin to teach their children to live quietly
in the ruins, avoiding conflicts with neighbours and with each other.
Anatomically and physiologically they are full-blooded people adapted to the
terrain, but their drive is so low that there is no development of the ethnos.
Even when someone with drive is born among them, he applies himself among
neighbours and not in the homeland. There are two possibilities: either those
remaining alive drag out a pitiable existence as a relict ethnos, or they fall
into a melting pot and, in favourable circumstances, a new ethnos is fused from
several fragments, only vaguely recalling its origin, because the date of its
new birth is far more important for it. And once again the process goes through
the same stages, unless it is accidentally cut short by an outside, external
influence.</p>
<p>There arc fewer striking examples to illustrate the phase of obscuration than
for other stages. The people of Europe, both Western and Eastern, are not so old
as to fall into a state of debility, so I must turn again to antiquity for
examples.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>From the golden age to decline.</font></i></b> Let me begin with the clearest
example, the Mediterranean in the fourth century B.C. It was then that the
aggression of the warlike Celts petered out; in the preceding century, they had
conquered lands in Spain and Italy and had inflicted heavy losses on the growing
culture of the Etruscans. In that same century the military and economic power
of Carthage was flourishing; and the complex state system of Rome, liberated
from Etruscan yoke, was taking shape. But the Greeks played the main role. They
were experiencing their most brilliant age and being converted from a mosaic
ethnos into a superethnos.</p>
<p>The Hellenist superethnos,, which included Macedonia, stretched from the
Indus in the east to Spain (Saguntum) and Gaul (Massilia) in the west, having
overawed the Punic and Etrurian ethnoi competing with it. Although both the
latter preserved their independence, they lost hegemony at sea. But the drain of
the element with drive to the frontier, together with the wars suffered in
recent time (the Peloponnesian, Theban, and Macedonian) made Hellas less
resistant, which is clear from the fact that the initiatives of Athens and
Sparta began to be seized by the semi-savage hillmen of the Epirus and Aetolia,
and the modest peasants of Achaea. Not that they had accumulated special power;
their strength proved sufficient, however, with the isolation of the former
centres of the drive, for them to join the struggle for hegemony with hope of
success. The same process, originating in Italy, elevated the robber republic on
the Seven Hills to the Eternal City of the ancient world. And here it may not be
out of place to make an important observation. The Romans' main rival, the
Samnites, who were not inferior to them in courage, had a custom of supplying
their young men as mercenaries sometimes to Carthage, sometimes to the Hellenic
cities of Taras (Tarentum), Syracuse, etc. Naturally, most of them went looking
for adventure and wealth and perished; and if they returned they were already
worn out and exhausted. The Romans, on the contrary, kept their youth at home,
although it gave them no little trouble. They thus preserved their stock of
drive and employed it in the wars with Pyrrhus and Hannibal, which gave Rome
power over the Mediterranean. Nevertheless this fund of energy was frittered
away which led to the reform of Gaius Marius, viz., the formation of a
professional standing army in which iron discipline made it possible to employ
people of sub-drive as rank-and-file soldiers. The structure of the Roman ethnos
disintegrated. Two subsystems developed, the Senate and the army. Under Julius
Caesar the army won, and won again after his death, under the command of
Octavian and Marcus Antonius. During the next three centuries the army drew into
itself the whole of the population of the Roman Empire with drive, and civil
wars were waged between military groupings made up of members of the various
ethnoi forming part of one superethnos, the Pax Romana.</p>
<p>The first war broke out in 68 A.D., when the propraetor of Gaul, Julius
Vindex, a descendant of the Aquitanian kings, led an uprising of his
fellow-tribesmen thirsting to free themselves from the power and exactions of
Rome. The Spanish legions joined the rebellion, proclaiming Servius Sulpicius
Galba emperor. But before Galba crossed the Pyrenees, the legions stationed on
the Upper Rhine came to blows with the Aquitanians. The leaders of the two
armies did not think of fighting, but their legionaries did not listen to them;
20 000 Aquitanians fell in battle, including Vindex.</p>
<p>Galba entered Rome at the lead of the Spanish legions and seven months later
was killed by the Praetorian Guard, natives of Italy, who proclaimed emperor
Otho, one of the late Nero's boon companions. But the legions of the Lower Rhine
rebelled, forcing their chief Vitellius to go with them to Rome. In A.D. 69
these provincials broke the Praetorian Guard. Otho plunged a dagger into his
breast. But the Syrian and Egyptian legions did not agree to recognize Vitellius
and forced their commander Vespasian to lead them in the struggle for power.</p>
<p>They were joined by the legions stationed in Mosses, Pannonia, and Illyrian
in order to avenge Otho on Vitellius. The commander of the German legions,
Caecina, tried in vain to surrender. The soldiers put him in chains, and went
into battle. Vespasian's army was victorious at Cremona, pillaged the town, and
killed all its inhabitants because they were Roman citizens and could not be
sold as slaves. Vitellius renounced power, but the troops who were in Rome did
not accept his abdication, attacked the Capitoline hill, killed Vespasian's
brother, the prefect of Rome, and fought each other until they were killed. And
the people of Rome went over to the next victor.</p>
<p>It is clear from this list of evil deeds that the Roman professional army had
detached itself from the Roman people and had become directly hostile to the
Senate. But it, too, did not constitute a single whole, being split into several
territorial consortia. The legionaries' stereotype of behaviour and that of
peaceful citizens diverged the more that provincials who had broken their ties
with their homelands and fellow-tribesmen for the sake of a soldier's life were
taken into the army.</p>
<p>The thirty legions that the Empire had in A.D. 70 had been reinforced not
only by callus and an influx of volunteers, but also by natural growth. In peace
time the legionaries worked plots of land for their own needs and, although they
did not have the right to marry, they took bedmates whose children also became
soldiers. The soldiers thus constituted a subethnos in the Roman Empire whose
significance grew year by year, and the stereotype of behaviour altered in
accordance with the conditions of life military service.</p>
<p>However badly Roman citizens treated their standing army, and however
brutally the soldiers made short work of the peaceful population whenever it
suited, one must say that the provinces grew rich and the capital enjoyed itself
only thanks to the legions. And the capital amused itself vilely with
gladiatorial battles, the baiting of animals, execution of Christians, the
insulting of female prisoners, and the sale of male and female slaves; such was
the Roman stereotype that excites the admiration of lovers of classical
antiquity.</p>
<p>Yet, for all the horrors described, the imperial age of Rome must be
considered the inertial phase of ethnogenesis. The Roman people expended their
own drive in maintaining their political system. Whereas surplus drive had
broken the rigid social system by means of civil war in the second and first
centuries B.C., and the energy and drive was as much as was needed at the turn
of the eras to maintain order and peace in the system, a need had arisen already
by the end of the first century A.D. to reinforce the army with people of
fighting efficiency, i.e. provincials with drive. That was the beginning of the
end.</p>
<p>What happened, Did the legions become weaker? Or the Empire's neighbours
stronger? Perhaps both at the same time. That, too, is important to me.</p>
<p>Of course, the part of the Roman ethnos (which coincided at that time with
the antique Graeco-Roman superethnos) that formed part of the legions lost drive
more rapidly than it would from battle losses only. During each of the many
revolts the soldiers avenged insults on the junior officer corps, i.e. killed
those officers who maintained discipline, which meant that there was an
extermination of the most responsible, resourceful, efficient, and dutiful
people, whose places were taken by unprincipled, venal persons. That degradation
was noted and described as regards the moral and cultural standards of the
'soldier' emperors, but it is more important for my theme to note that it
affected all strata of the army, which at that time involved the whole drive
element of the Roman ethnos, because only in the army could an ambitious youth
make a career, even at the risk of his life.</p>
<p>Inertia maintained the existing system until the end of the second century
A.D., and was exhausted. Then the time for a new phase arrived.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Bloody gloom</font></i><font COLOR="#ff0000">.</font></b> The phases of
ethnogenesis pass so smoothly one into the other that they are unnoticeable for
contemporaries as a rule. But it is clear to the historian that the transitions
coincide with important events whose significance is only apparent from a
distance.</p>
<p>The decisive turning point in the fate of the Roman ethnos occurred in A.D.
193, after the mad emperor Commodus was assassinated.</p>
<p>It is worth concentrating attention on those events. The monster born in the
purple lost a tablet in his favourite concubine's bed with the names on it of
those doomed to death. Her name was on it, too. She showed it to the other named
victims, and a specially invited gladiator Narcissus finished the scoundrel off.
The Senate appointed a venerable old man, Pertinax, emperor. The Praetorians
recognized him, since he was known as an honest, brave, efficient administrator,
and a well-meaning, just, and meek ruler. Those condemned, though guiltless,
were released from prison and brought back from exile. Informers were punished.
Order was restored in legal proceedings and management. Pertinax halved
expenditure on the palace, and sold off the slaves with whom Commodus had
debauched himself. The country, it seemed, was reviving within only three
months.</p>
<p>One day a crowd of Praetorians came to the palace. The sentries admitted
them. They killed Pertinax. The people wept. So ended the attempt to save the
fatherland.</p>
<p>The Praetorians proposed to give the throne to whoever would pay them most.
It was bought by a rich Senator Didius Julianus, who had been the ruler of
remote provinces for a long time, and who had stolen much money there. His
authority got no support. The Senators and equites hid their feelings but the
mob quarrelled with them. There was no relying on the Praetorians. The Guard was
no longer the valiant legionaries who had defended their leader Otho in A.D. 69
from Vitellius' terrible border troops. They had become so corrupt over 124
years that no one believed them or respected them.</p>
<p>The proconsuls of the provinces immediately opposed the Roman legionaries. In
Britannia Claudius Albinus, a friend of Marcus Aurelius and Commodus, who hid
all his unnatural vices under the cloak of a philosopher, proposed to his troops
to restore freedom. In Syria Pescennius Niger, an efficient and affable ruler,
popular in his province and in Rome, had many chances for success. In Pannonia
Septimius Severus, a Roman equite and native of Africa, ambitious and secretive,
seized the initiative. He exploited the factor of speed. Being close to Rome, he
entered the eternal city without a fight. Didius Julianus, deserted and betrayed
by the Practorians, was killed in his palace.</p>
<p>But the Praetorians, who had gone out to meet the usurper with laurel
wreaths, miscalculated. Septimius Severus ordered his seasoned troops to disarm
them, and then sent them off to various provincial cohorts. Once conquered
Illyria and Thrace thus gained the upper hand over Rome. After bloody victories
over Niger and Albinus, won thanks to the courage of the Thraco-Illyrian legions
which, unlike the Syrian and British legions, were recruited in their own
provinces, Septimius Severus improved the position of the soldiers and increased
the army by natives of the eastern provinces (Illyrians, Thracians, Galatians,
Moors, lazyges, Arabs, etc.). As a result almost the whole Roman army proved to
be made up of foreigners at the beginning of the third century A.D. That shows
that the Roman ethnos, which had ceased to supply volunteer defenders of the
homeland, had lost drive. The structure, language, and culture of the Empire
still remained, through inertia, at a time when real Romans could be counted by
separate families, even in Italy, which was settled by immigrants from Syria and
descendants of war-prisoner slaves (colons).</p>
<p>The military dictatorship of the Severans prolonged the existence of the
Roman system for forty years; then things began to happen. In A.D. 235 the
soldiers killed Alexander Severus and his wise mother Mamaea, and gave the
throne to a Thracian Maximinus. The Proconsul of Africa, Gordianus, a Roman of
long standing, together with his son, opposed Maximinus. Both were killed. In
A.D. 238 the soldiers filled Maximinus, and the Praetorians, the two consuls
Pupienus and Balbinus. The Praetorian prefect Philip the Arabian killed
Gordianus III in A.D. 244, and was himself killed by Decius in 249. After the
death of Decius in battle with the Goths, the soldiers betrayed and killed
Gallus, and then Aemillianus. His rival Valerian, whom the army refused to obey
at the decisive moment and demanded should surrender to the Persians, died in a
'tower of silence'. The Empire split into three parts: in the West there was the
usurper Posturn, in the East the Palmyran king Odaenathus, who repulsed the
Persians; while in Rome the following were successively murdered: Gallienus,
Aurelius, Claudius 11, Quintilian, who reigned for 17 days, and finally
Aurelian, who restored order and united the Empire in A.D. 270 before the
emancipated slave Mnestius (murdered in turn) killed him in 275.</p>
<p>Then, in turn, the elder consul Tacitus, his brother Florian, the Pannonian
officer Probus, Carus, and Numerian were murdered. Only in September 284 was
Diocletian proclaimed, who took advantage of the murder of his rival Carinus
(son of Carus) in 285 by his own comrades-in-arms, and became emperor.</p>
<p>This long fist of regicides helps us understand the course of ethnic
development when we take into account that far more ordinary people were killed.
Before us is the phase of obscuration, when a capable military leader trying to
restore discipline for the sake of victory was regarded as the worst enemy,
worse than the real one. Instinctive reactions (irritation, greed, laziness) not
being counterbalanced by lost drive, made the Roman army a crowd of villains and
traitors. And it was not that there was no determined general or clever diplomat
for half-a-century. There were plenty of them in that vast country, but there
were few true executives. And since the number of them was diminishing all the
time, because they were killed along with the emperors, the stereotype of
behaviour also changed, i.e. the phase of ethnogenesis. The Roman ethnos had
died and rotten before perishing from the invasion of barbarians.</p>
<p>Diocletian understood that only a backward province could save him. He
therefore divided care for defense of the frontiers with three companions,
established his residence in the Asia Minor town of Nicomedia, far from Rome,
and surrounded himself with troops from Illyrian, Thracian, and Moesian
mountaineers who had not yet lost their fighting capacity. He created a
bureaucracy, because he did not, with every justification, trust the corrupt
society. He persecuted Christians and Manichaeans because these communities
lived by their own laws and not his. In short, he exploited the inertia, not of
the ethnos (because that was exhausted) but of the culture created by preceding
generations. But he, too, capitulated to the force of things, since he became
the emperor of a state (dominus) and not the head of a republic (princeps).</p>
<p>Diocletian's state was Roman only in name. In essence it was an association
of all the countries of the Mediterranean basin that completely ignored the
ethnic principle. A large part of the Empire's population were drawn into the
whirlwind of obscuration, i.e. lost its ethnic affiliation, having exchanged it
for participation in the superethnos. These people were bound only by a cultural
tradition expressed in skillful administration, which meant that true patriotism
was replaced by obedience to magistrates appointed from a number of chance
persons who had connections and had lost conscience. Such a system could not be
strong. But it held together in spite of the efforts of its own population
because viable consortia had arisen in it. They were hostile to the traditions
of the Roman ethnos, but not to the dominant, in spite of the latter's not
caring for them. And soon after the death of the first dominus, these new forces
galvanized the corpse of ancient Rome.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The substitute.</font></i></b> For all that, the Roman army, in spite of the
tragic position, held the frontier along the Rhine, and Hadrian's Wall in
Northern Britannia, and coped well with the Numidians and Moors. Things were
more serious in the east. Goth vessels penetrated the Aegean; Persia, though
disposing of only a fiftieth of the resources, successfully waged war in
Mesopotamia; and it needed exertion of all the forces of the Roman Empire to
crush the Dacians and the Judeans in the second century A.D. In fact, only the
Illyro-Thracian units and their leaders who became emperors, from Aurelian to
Diocletian, saved the Empire in the third century. These leaders included the
famous general Aetius, who is called 'the last Roman'. But matters were not so
simple.</p>
<p>Anyone who joined the legions in Thrace and Illyricum obviously belonged to
the number of people of the same stamp as those who joined the Christian
communities. Their dominant was of course different, but for my analysis that
has no significance. What is important is that in interpolating the impulse of
drive I take in just those areas of the Balkan Peninsula where it should have
occurred, theoretically speaking, and get confirmation of it there. Consequently
Aetius and his legionaries should be considered the 'first Byzantine' rather
than the 'last Roman'. I thus establish that, from the second century A.D.,
there was an upsurge in the activity of the population in the eastern provinces
of the Roman Empire and in certain areas lying to the north of them. Outside the
Empire, this was the beginning of the ethnogenesis of new peoples (Goths, Ants,
and Vandals) Inside the Empire this rise in drive acquired an original dominant,
the creation of confessional communities on a mixed ethnic basis, either
Christian or gnostic and pagan (Neoplatonic). It is customary to say that
Christianity was the religion of the slaves. That is partly true, but it loses
sight of the fact that the slaves in their overwhelming majority were
replenished by prisoners of war. Marriages between slaves of different tribes
were permitted by their masters, but mixed marriages with those of other faiths
were prohibited by the leaders of the Christian communities, which I venture to
call consortia. Thus hybrids which, as we know, possess heightened lability,
were grouped together in the Christian consortia. Such forms are usually
unstable and disintegrate in two or three generations, but there was an
additional factor at work here which gave Christian communities stability, viz.,
immense drive. Thanks to matchless sacrifice and in spite of cruel persecution,
the Christian community, already given organization (the Church), replaced the
imperial power in A.D. 313.</p>
<p>Christians were the most loyal subjects of the Emperor Diocletian, and the
most disciplined soldiers, but when pagan sacrifices were made in the camps, at
which the legionaries had to be present, they shielded themselves by the sign of
the cross, which in Diocletian's opinion destroyed the force of the ritual. In
A.D. 303 he started a persecution of Christians which was the last in the Roman
Empire. It lasted only two years, because Diocletian abdicated in 305 and
retired to Illyricum where his villa was as big as the town of Spalato (Split).
He died in 313 after learning that his wife and daughter had been brutally
murdered, and that something worse than death lay ahead for him.</p>
<p>Diocletian was a bureaucratic genius. He saw it was impossible to govern a
country from the Euphrates to Gibraltar and the Tweed without an executive
administration. He divided the Empire into four parts, making his
comrade-in-arms Maximinus his colleague, also bearing the title of Augustus,
while Galerius and Constantius Chlorus were appointed Caesars. After his
abdication, Galerius, the initiator of the persecution of the Christians, became
Augustus of the East, and the humane and gentle Constantius Chlorus, whose son
was Constantine, Augustus of the West. The persecution of Christians ceased in
Gaul and Britannia, since Diocletian edicts were simply not enforced.</p>
<p>In A.D. 306 Italy rose against Galerius; the leader of the uprising was the
son of Diocletian's Caesar Maxentius, a coarse, giftless, dissolute man. But
when Galerius tried to pacify Italy, he was defeated and died in 311, leaving
power in the Balkan Peninsula to his friend Licinius. Maxentius' brother
Maximinus ruled in Asia Minor, Syria, and Egypt.</p>
<p>Both brothers were such that it seemed that the times not even of Nero but of
Caligula, Commodus, and Caracalla had returned. Both were consumed by hatred for
Constantine and Licinius. War broke out in A.D. 312-313. Those who were aided by
the Christians √ Constantine and Licinius √ won. Yet the strength of
authority, numerical superiority, economic resources, and even the influence of
old traditions were with Maxentius and Maximinus. But they were killed. It
happened like this.</p>
<p>In 312 Constantine crossed the Alps with 40 000 troops, mainly Gauls, against
an enemy with a four-to-one superiority. He won several battles in the valley of
the Po, reached the Tiber, and there clashed with the army of Maxentius.</p>
<p>Constantine raised a banner on which a radiant cross was depicted. His Gallic
cavalry routed Maxentius' Roman cavalry on both flanks, while the veteran border
troops cut down the Praetorians Maxentius drowned in the Tiber while fleeing.</p>
<p>Licinius had married Constantine's sister, and the two Augustuses published
an edict on tolerance in Milan, which granted Christians freedom of worship.
Licinius then went to the East, where Maximinus was invading Thrace from Syria.
Licinius' Illyrian soldiers were more capable of fighting than Maximinus' Syrian
legionaries who were a motley crowd. Licinius was victorious at Heraclea in 313,
and Maximinus died, probably poisoned.</p>
<p>Having won, Licinius displayed the same cruelty to people who were not guilty
of anything toward him but who happened to be in his power. In A.D. 315 he
inspired a conspiracy against Constantine and then ordered the overthrow of
Constantine's statues in the border town of Aemon. Constantine declared war and
twice defeated Licinius' army, after which the latter sued for peace.
Constantine took Macedonia and Greece away from Licinius, leaving him the rest
of the East.</p>
<p>The struggle between the two rulers was postponed, but both understood that
it was inevitable. Constantine had the powerful support of the Christians of the
whole Empire.</p>
<p>What remained for Licinius to do, who had also promulgated the Edict of Milan
in his possessions in the struggle with Maximinus, thanks to which his soldiers
had called on the aid of the 'Supreme God' and received it in the battle of
Heraclea? But since Constantine's mother Helena was a Christian, and he himself
was the recognized leader of the Christian party, it was only left to Licinius
to revive persecution. In 324 the armies of the contenders for absolute power
clashed at Adrianople and Licinius' Thraco-Illyrian legions, vaunted for their
bravery, which outnumbered the enemy were routed. They lost a second battle on
the other side of the Bosphorus at Chrysopolis. Licinius surrendered, having
beer, given a promise of mercy, but within a few months he was strangled (A.D.
324). It is not worth pitying him; he himself killed innocent people. He should
have shared the fate of the soldiers who perished for him, and not hidden behind
the skirts of his wife, Constantine's sister.</p>
<p>That war did not reflect the rivalry of the old pagan ethnos with the new
Christian one, but a struggle for predominance between two subethnoi of an
already established ethnos, from which Byzantium arose. As for the descendants
of the Romans who were not yet dissolved in the regenerated ethnic system, the
phase of obscuration had ended for them, and a time had begun when they could no
longer act in any way. All that remained for them was to remember.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>It is thus everywhere.</font></i></b> The material cited is sufficient for a
conclusion. The drive of the antique or Helleno-Roman superethnos faded, being
crystallized in a civilization capable of holding out against the pressure of
neighbours through accumulated inertia. This system was blown up from within by
a powerful excess or impulse of drive that took place in the region of
Scandinavia, Eastern Europe, Asia Minor, &quot;d Syria. This localization shows
that the phenomenon described has no connection with the social crisis of the
slaveowning system and was not the fruit of the conscious activity of people who
died not understanding why things had suddenly become bad for them.</p>
<p>Neither Diocletian's bureaucratic genius nor Constantine's political
resourcefulness, nor Theodosius' military talents could stem the process and
save the country. In the East where the new ethnos took shape, that I
arbitrarily call Byzantine, the barbarians were repelled; in the West they
simply replaced the disappearing Roman citizens.</p>
<p>The same process occurred in Byzantium under the Angelus dynasty and ended
with the fall of Constantinople in 1204. The outburst of patriotism in the
Empire of Nicaea revived the ramshackle country for a time, but the process of
ethnic decline continued, and even the courage of John VI Cantacuzene could not
stop it. The Byzantine people disappeared, dissolved and deformed a long time
before the Ottoman Turks broke into defenseless, or rather lacking the will to
defend itself, Constantinople (5 May 1453).</p>
<p>The Achaemenid Empire perished from an external blow, and obscuration came
later in the Near East. It facilitated victory not to Alexander the Great, but
to Sulla, Lucullus and Pompeius, Titus and Trajan, and to Arsaces, the leader of
the Saki who founded the Parthian Empire on the ruins of ancient Iran.</p>
<p>In mediaeval China obscuration arrived stealthily little by little. In the
middle of the seventeenth century, the rotting Ming bureaucracy capitulated to
the peasant rising of Li Tzu-cheng, and the latter was subsequently beaten by a
blitz by a handful of Manchus, only just united by Prince Nurhatsi. <a name="ebe6text54"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note54">[+54]</a> After that China was in a state of catalepsy for two hundred years, which gave
European observers an excuse for regarding the temporary lethargy as an
inseparable property of Chinese culture. This, in fact, was not the sickness of
a growing culture, but the natural aging of an ethnos that had survived for more
than a thousand years (A.D. 581-1681).</p>
<p>Strange as it may seem, the phase of obscuration does not always lead to
death of an ethnos, although it always does irreparable harm to the ethnic
culture. When it develops rapidly and there are no predatory neighbours near,
thirsting for conquests, the imperative 'be like us' finds a logical reaction of
the person 'Mine is the day!', with the result that the very. possibility of
preserving the ethnic dominant and of any collective measures, even destructive
ones, disappears. Purposeful development degenerates into a kind of 'Brownian
movement' in which the elements (individual people or smallish consortia that
preserve tradition, even partially) get a chance to oppose the tendency to
progressing decline. When there is even a little drive and inertia of the
everyday norms developed by the ethnos in preceding phases, they conserve
separate 'islets' of culture, creating a deceptive impression that the existence
of the ethnos as an integral system has not ceased. That is self-deception. The
system has disappeared, and only individual people and their memory of the past
survive.</p>
<p>The phase of obscuration is awful because it is a series of breaks, be they
even small. Adaptation to such rapid and constant changes of the environment is
inevitably delayed, and the ethnos perishes.</p>
<p>It is thus clear that people with drive do not dislodge anyone from an
ethnos, but by adding themselves and their deeds create a diversity that
complicates the ethnic system<i>. And complex systems are more stable than
simplified ones.</p>
</i>
<p>Such is the mechanism of ethnogenesis, a natural process. And clearly,
neither St. Augustine's idea of the City of God, nor the Hegelian longing for
the Absolute, not Jaspers' philosophical existence are applicable to explain
this phenomenon.</p>
<b>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">After the End</p>
<i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The memorial phase.</font></i></b> Memory of the past survives the inertia of
the impulse of drive, but individual people are not in a position to retain it.
Their efforts are not supported by contemporaries, though they are not
fruitless. The works of poets are preserved as folklore, artists' masterpieces
become the motives of folk art, the history of the feats of defenders of the
homeland are converted into legends or ballads in which accuracy of description
is counterposed to the genre.</p>
<p>We find such a picture in the Altai. Six tribes live there, the three
northern ones of which are Turkicized Ugrians, and the three southern remains of
ancient Turks. The Telesi are descendants of Turkuts, the Telenkite and Teleuts
are tribes of the Teles group to which the Uighurs belong, and the Altai-Kizhi
are a branch of the Naimans who came to the Altai in the twelfth century. All
have a rich ballad epic, many of the subjects of which arose in the days of the
Turkic Kaghanate the sixth to eighth centuries that perished in struggle with
the Tang Dynasty. The Turkuts who saved themselves from the slaughter, hid away
in the valleys of the High Altai, and there awaited the time of their rebirth in
vain. They passed into a state close to homeostasis, but preserved their heroic
poetry as a memory of the past.</p>
<p>The same memory of events not only of days of yore but also of the
comparatively recent past (of the war with the Chinese in the nineteenth
century) is preserved by the Kirghiz of the Tien Shan, the Jungar Oirats, the
Pueblo Indians (Tewa), and many other, once powerful ethnoi, which have become
small, not very numerous 'tribes'. Crystallized drive, or art, saved them from
dissolution into neighbours, from assimilation and the abasement associated with
that.</p>
<p>Ethnoi that are in this phase of ethnogenesis always evoke a feeling of
profound respect among ethnographers and 'harmonious' (in the sense of degree of
drive) colonists who find a common language with the aborigines. But among
people of sub-drive and rapacious people with drive they arouse a savage,
unrestrained hatred that excluded any possibility of peaceful contact. That is
especially clearly marked in the history of North America.</p>
<p>Most of the Indian tribes living between the Atlantic and the prairies had
already experienced their dynamic period before the arrival of Europeans. An
exception was the Iroquois, who had settled in the basin of Lake Ontario from
the west not long before the arrival of Europeans, and possibly the Seminoles.
Both bore the impress of drive and evoked the ferocious hatred of the white
settlers. But the Algonquians, the old inhabitants of this territory, and the
cultured Natchez in Louisiana, mercilessly exterminated by the French, were made
a model of courage, honesty, loyalty, and other good qualities in European
literature. So Fenimore Cooper and Chateaubriand depicted them. But as soon as
the Europeans clashed with Indians with drive (Apaches, Navajo, Comanches), the
image of the Indians was darkened. And the quiet, industrious Pueblo Indians did
not get a just evaluation at all. European authors were more interested by their
traditional architecture than by them themselves. And that was no accident. The
Indian farmers were a very old people; much of their culture has been lost. The
Algonquians preserved much but could not keep the drive without which it was
impossible to maintain independence; consequently they were forced to make
friends with the French and English. But the Iroquois knew how to defend
themselves; only division during the revolt of the colonies destroyed them. Some
of them sided with England, some with the Americans; and both slaughtered them.</p>
<p>There are very many isolated ethnoi, remembering and valuing their culture,
but there are also subethnoi, removed from forward movement by the calamities of
historical fate and consciously preferring to preserve the stereotype of their
way of life, if only to preserve the memory, dear to them, of the 'beautiful
past'. Even at the beginning of the nineteenth century the Old Believer
communities in the Russian Empire lived that way. Under Catherine the Great the
Old Believers were saved from persecution for their beliefs and could keep up
the rites and rituals they considered 'old'.</p>
<p>That was a sincere delusion. They did not preserve the customs of the age of
Andrei Rublev and St. Nilus of the Sora, but those established by the middle of
the seventeenth century when, after the Time of Troubles and the Polish and
Swedish intervention, the reaction to everything foreign became very sharp. But
having fixed precisely that moment in the intellectual and aesthetic life in
Russia they did not want to reject it. They could have lived indefinitely in
that way if they had not been eroded away by their surroundings, i.e. by living,
pulsing reality, and the actually occurring processes of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>And the opponents of the founders of Old Believerdom √ the scaramouches √
proved to be in the same position. Exiled in the seventeenth century to the
north because their songs, dances, masquerades, and stories of the ballads drew
people away from observance of fasts and Church rituals, these unfortunate
artistes handed their art down to their children until folklorists collected
them, i.e. until the middle of the nineteenth century. Happily, it was not too
late. They succeeded in recording and publishing a great deal. So, thanks to the
memorial phase of a tiny convicinity (not even a subethnos), we Russians know
that our forefathers were not savages, nor illiterates, nor dunces waiting for
enlightenment from Europe. Because the illiteracy mine later with the
superceding of the old tradition by semi-literacy, i.e. in the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>The examples cited witness that after the end of the dynamic phases of
ethnogenesis the surviving people by no means become worse, i.e. weaker, or more
stupid, than those who up to then had constituted the overwhelming majority of
the ethnos. It is not the people who have changed but the ethnic system's
integrity. Earlier, along with the majority there had been a yeast of drive,
exciting the system, interfering with everything, but giving the system, i.e.
the ethnos, resistivity and a striving for changes. The ideal then, or rather
forecasts for the distant future, were development, but now the ideal has become
conservation. The aggressiveness of the ethnic system, naturally, disappears,
and its resistivity is lowered, but the law of drive entropy continues to
operate. Only instead of gains there are losses. And much in this depends on the
character of the ethnic environment.</p>
<p>A subethnos that Lis lost the inertia of development is, of course, doomed,
but the, people that constitute it have a chance of mixing with other subethnoi
within their ethnos. Here they are at home and nobody is going to kill them. But
a defenceless ethnos surrounded by members of other superethnoi is a picture
that chills the blood. The English did not consider the Tasmanians people, and
rounded them up and got rid of them. The Argentinians carried out a 'shoot' of
the Patagonians, and sold the Tierra del Fuegans blankets infected with
smallpox. The Bantu Negroes caught Bushmen in order to use them for heavy work,
but were themselves made slaves by the Boers. In order to repel a merciless
enemy an ethnos had to expend the remains of drive; for the bravest resisted,
i.e. the most vigorous and energetic. But people of sub-drive hid themselves
where they could, thanks to which they prolonged their fife but without any hope
of victory. That is the mechanism of the tragedy of the ethnoi that evolutionist
ethnographers have christened 'primitive'.</p>
<p>But even if these islets of culture in the sea of ignorance and ferocity were
able to hold out and not sink into chaos annihilating itself, they are powerless
against the last relict phase preceding homeostasis, in which the descendants of
members of the most sluggish convicinities that have long ago lost drive, are
guided by the imperative 'Troll! To thyself be enough!', <a name="ebe6text55"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note55">[+55]</a> because they are no longer members of an ethnos, as a system, but like the
trolls inhabiting undergrowth and gorges (according to the beliefs of the old
Norwegians); the phrase I have taken is from Ibsen, because it is very suitable
for them. It means: 'Try not to get in the way of others, do not pester them,
but do not grieve yourself, and have pity on nothing.'</p>
<p>The extermination of such nice, innocent people, honest, hospitable, and
benevolent, is like the murder of children, i.e. it is a crime that is
unforgivable.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The transition to nowhere.</font></i></b> Another way out would seem to be
possible, viz., isolation. I would like to think that, in favourable conditions,
an ethnos could, without outside pressure, endlessly preserve its original
culture and developed stereotype of behaviour. Even if everything around
crumbled to dust or was ground to powder by impulses of drive, the ethnos would
reproduce itself: so many naive people think.</p>
<p>But the fact is that people in the last phase of ethnogenesis lose the sense
of time along with memory of the past, at first outside their own individual or
family biography. In the final stages they are limited to recording the time of
year and even simply day and night. I myself observed that among Chukchi: the
change of winter to summer was outside their ken. At the same time the Chukchi
are fine hunters, have a developed mythology, and are very brave and ingenious.
The absence of a chronology by no means prevents them from living.</p>
<p>Europeans who have associated closely with the Pygmies of Central Africa have
painted a similar picture. A Pygmy does not know how old he is because a year is
too long a period for him and he has no need to count his years. In other things
Pygmies are very intelligent, orientate themselves beautifully in the tropical
forest, where not only Europeans but also Bantu immediately lose their way. The
Bantu live in close contact with the Pygmies, employing them as guides, for
which they supply them with iron, because the Bantu are wonderful smiths. And
what is most important for my theme: it is necessary to pay the Pygmies for
their services, but only after they have done the work, without making an
advance, because they work only in order to satisfy a pressing need or fancy.
Here is a very graphic example.</p>
<p>The Pygmies know what no one except them knows, viz., how to build a bridge
across a wide river from lianas. A narrow river can be waded, but a broad one is
dangerous, because of crocodiles. So it is necessary to build a bridge, and the
sole material is lianas and two trees, one on one bank and one on the other.
Here is how the Pygmies do it; they tie a liana to a palm-tree, and a youth
clings to it. They swing him se that he flies to the opposite bank and catches
hold of another palm there; if he misses and does not catch it, the liana flies
back, and he may be killed against the bole of the first palm. It is a very
dangerous business but they know how to do it. Then they pull other lianas along
the first, and make a wonderful suspension bridge. An American cameraman wanted
to film the building of such a bridge and was acquainted with a Pygmy who knew
how to do this dangerous work. The American promised to pay him well if he would
demonstrate his skill before the camera. But the Pygmy replied: 'No, I won't do
anything; I don't need anything from you. I've already worked for you and you
gave me a knife. There is the knife; you gave me a kettle √ there it is; you
even gave me a chisel √ very good, thank you. But I do not need anything more;
why should I risk myself?' 'So just in case'. 'What? What's in case; I don't
understand what you are saying, stupid white man.' Then the American, for all
that, hit on an idea. He learned that this Pygmy wanted to marry, but had to pay
bride-price. A woman there is a valuable, not as with us; it is necessary to pay
for her and to respect her; a woman is a great matter. He said: 'I will buy you
a bride, if only you will do it.' And the Pygmy made a bridge and got a bride.</p>
<p>But the concept 'a stock for the future' is as foreign to Pygmies as the past
before the birth of a given Pygmy. Neither the one nor the other interests him.
Contact with the Bantu supports the Pygmies, stimulates them, without thereby
depriving them of their accustomed geographical environment, because no one ever
encroaches on the tropical jungle. Thanks to the symbiosis established the
Pygmies have survived for centuries.</p>
<p>It thus turns out that ethnoi that have lost past drive can exist at the
expense of the drive of a neighbour ethnos passed to them not sexually but
through systems links. Symbiosis is a complicated system beneficial for both
parties. The sole danger in it lies in attempts to translate the ethnic contact
into a modus of assimilation, but that is always a pain of age of the inertial
phase when people begin to invent things instead of studying the reality around
them. No one has yet found a more successful variant than that existing in
nature.</p>
<p>Thus, even in the final phases of ethnogenesis there is a need for drive,
even though borrowed. That is why drive impulses not only destroy ethnoi that
are in their neighbourhood, but also save them.</p>
<p>But when an ethnos in this phase is completely isolated, and an impulse of
drive passes right by their habitat, an even sorrier end sets in. Let us turn to
the facts, because no one wants to believe logic.</p>
<p>On the Little Andaman Island the small Negrito tribe of the Onghies lives in
a marvellous climate and luxurious nature. No one has ever done them down. A
reservation has been established there and not even tourists are admitted. The
inhabitants are peaceful, friendly, honest, and very clean. They are
food-gatherers and fishers. Illnesses are a rarity among them, and if there is a
case the warden of the reserve gives help. It would seem a paradise √ but the
population is declining. They are simply too lazy to live. They sometimes prefer
to starve than hunt for food. The women do not want to bear children. The
children are taught only one thing √ how to swim. The adults want only one
thing from the civilized world tobacco. For all that the Onghies are very
sensitive to justice and do not bear humiliation. Their women are chaste, and
when a visiting Burman tried to make love to them, the Onghies killed him, and
then reported that to the authorities not as an offence but as an establishing
of order. It goes without saying that no question of punishment arose. Rightly!
One shouldn't poke one's nose into the affairs of another ethnos.</p>
<p>But there was something strange about this. The director of the
Anthropological Department, an educated Indian named Choudhary, told the author
of this story, Suresh Vaidya:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Their [the Onghies'. √ Ed.] way of life is what mankind lived twenty
  thousand years ago. For them nothing has changed. They eat what nature gives,
  and for warmth they depend on the sun and the fire. <a name="ebe6text56"></a><a href="ebe6c.htm#ebe6note56">[+56]</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That is the strength of the hypnosis of an uncritically accepted evolutionary
theory of ethnogenesis. And how, in the opinion of the Indian scientist, did the
ancestors of the Onghies get to the Andaman Islands? For they must have known
not just coasting navigation. And they hardly drifted by chance across the very
stormy Indian Ocean. Bows and arrows would have had to be invented, or borrowed
from neighbours. Their marriage customs, which forbid a second marriage even it
the case of early widowhood, and limit marriage with close relatives, are by no
means primitive. The Onghies' language has not yet been studied, but when it is
it will probably turn out that they have recollections of ancestors, myths, and
tales not yet quite forgo: ten. But the life tone of the Onghies has been
lowered. A quarter of the young women are barren. If that is how matters stood
twenty thousand years ago, the ancestors of the Onghies would long have been
extinct.</p>
<p>No, the Onghies, and ethnoi like them, are not children, but oldsters. People
without drive are less adapted to fife on Earth than animals. Those in stable,
favourable conditions do not die out. Even the crocodiles on these same Andaman
Islands, learned to keep under cover when hunters with guns appeared. They did
not fear the aborigines with bows and arrows.</p>
<p>At that level of drive ethnogenesis ends.</p>
<p>But besides the direct processes of ethnogenesis lying in the biosphere and
therefore not initiating phenomena of destruction, there is a distortion of
development in which irreversible simplifications of the ecosystems arise. They
can be understood as an ethnic formation with a negative sign; but that calls
for special discussion.</p>

as a systems entity encounters great difficulties. The traditional methods of
the natural sciences, which make it possible not only to describe processes but
also to establish their genesis, prove not to be exhaustive because of the
absence of datings, even not very rigorous ones. It has been readily noted, for
example, that as a consequence of shifting of the path of cyclones, protracted,
age-long droughts set in in a certain region, and as a consequence of that the
character of the vegetation and consequently of the fauna, was altered, but it
is impossible, without an absolute chronology, to establish the dates of the
beginning and end of the phenomenon. Chronology is the business of history but,
alas, historians have dodged doing their job.</p>
<p>And that is not by chance. History as the science of events in their
connections and sequence, had completed its accumulative period by the end of
the eighteenth century; then a need developed for its interpretation, which
found completion in historical materialism.</p>
<font FACE="Arial CYR" SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="gml_pics/fig3.gif" width="115" height="499"></p>
</font>
<p>But disclosure of the social patterns, viz., the progressive development of
the productive forces and relations of production, described only one aspect of
a multi-faceted phenomenon, and man's relationship with the biosphere remained
within the jurisdiction of dialectical materialism. Historians were not prepared
for that division, and gave themselves up to refining the details in
communications of the sources. In that connection, however, the contours of the
main object of ethnic history, viz., the discrete centuries-old process of
ethnogenesis, and its beginning and end, were inevitably lost. That led to a
substitution of numerous descriptions of 'Brownian movement' in history as its
real development, in place of real historical analysis. But even a drop from a
cloud does not fall straight down.</p>
<p>No protracted movement or motion is simple. It includes a number of fine
deviations that compensate each other.</p>
<p>But imagine an observer who is studying not the whole trajectory of the
falling of a drop but any two centimetres in the middle of its path. He will
inevitably conclude that New ton's law is false; for the drop, according to his
observation, does not just move down but to the side, and often upward. His
conclusion is false but logical, because the mistake is la╜tent in the posing
of the problem, which ad╜mits the right of the investigator to narrow the theme
without coordinating it with sur╜rounding problems.</p>
<p>But don't say that that does not happen! A similar method, leading to obvious
fallacies and errors, was the trouble with Thor Heyerdahl's A'Khu.</p>
<p>The interpretation presented aimed not so much at clarifying history as at
understanding it as a means of deciding problems of natural science, in
particular of study of the bio╜sphere. I therefore suggest a hierarchy of
approximations to the reader, which makes it possible to observe the principle
of scale and employ the whole of the needed historical material (see Table 3).</p>
<font FACE="Arial CYR" SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="gml_pics/fig4.gif" width="354" height="352"></p>
</font>
<p>By using the table of successive approximations one can find the place of an
eth╜nogenesis, experiencing the effect not only of the biosphere but also of
spontaneous social development. This effect is mediated by the so-called 'logic
of events', i.e. by the section of history from which it began to be studied
(wars, diplomacy, internal revolutions, con╜quest of power, and so on). This
material is abundant but its use calls for strict observ╜ance of scale so that
unimportant events are not ranked together with major ones. The fate of separate
individuals is therefore placed two orders lower than the fate of social systems
(see Fig. 3).</p>
<font FACE="Arial CYR" SIZE="2">
<p>&nbsp;<img border="0" src="gml_pics/fig5.gif" width="341" height="267"></p>
</font>
<p>The variation of an ethnic system's drive deserves special attention. A rise
in the drive of a whole ethnos, but not of the individuals who compose it,
occurs uniformly as a rule: growth of the function D, fluctuations of D at
certain levels, during overheating, a steep short fall during a break, and a
smooth inertial phase. The movement of the level of D is shown by the unbroken
line marked <b><i>a</i></b>. Variations of the acme phase are shown by the
broken line, and a sudden break and decline (usually caused by a blow from
outside) is marked by the letter <b><i>b</i></b> (see Fig. 4).</p>

</font>
<p>In conclusion, as a resume, I propose a table of the generalized content of
the whole conception of ethnogenesis, in its substantial part.</p>

their Judaic origin after liberation, and remained in Babylon. In the sixth
century B.C. Babylon had been converted from the capital of monoethnic Akkadia
