<h3><a name="sik5para13">13. An Attempt to Overcome Self-deception</a></h3>
<h4>A Spoken Thought</h4>
<p>For a start let us return to the problem of what the writings
of ancient authors signify for us and for our time. Apart from an elementary
antiquarianism, the aim of which is aesthetic appreciation or admiration, two
cognitive approaches are possible, both equally scholarly: the study of sources
and that of history.</p>
<p>In the first approach, the work is regarded as a source of
information, in other words we seek to extract a fragment of information from it
and with that fill the void of our ignorance. As a rule this succeeds, but the
result, as we have seen, is always less than expected, because any information
is incomplete, or we ourselves perceive it inadequately. Yet it is impossible to
avoid this approach, for only in this way can we obtain the primary information
which is then processed by means of historical criticism.</p>
<p>In the second approach, used extremely rarely, we regard the
literary work as a historical fact or event. How, for instance, does the
publication of Luther's theses, nailed to the doors of Wittenburg Cathedral on
31 October 1517, differ from the battle of Marignan which had taken place two
years earlier?</p>
<p>If we judge by the consequences, one poor monk had done more
than the whole French army headed by Francis I. But even if we refrain from
evaluation, both are facts for the historian, i.e. measures of the coming into
being of history. It is from this angle that we shall try to approach the Lay of
Igor's Host, a work of ancient Russian literature, without at all intending to
compete with the language and literature specialists who work with other methods
and set themselves other aims. We shall look at the subject concerned in a way
which no one has yet done; with the eyes of a historian of the nomads, from the
depths of the Asian steppes.</p>
<p>From the moment it appeared out of the mists of oblivion, the
Lay <b><font COLOR="#943634">{286} </font></b>of Igor's Host (hereafter, the
Lay) began to evoke arguments. Three points of view have been formed. The first,
now dominant in literary studies: the Lay is a twelfth-century text composed by
a contemporary, possibly even by a participant in the events described.  <a name="sik5text1"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note1">[+1]</a>
The second: the Lay is a forgery dating from the eighteenth century, when the
passion for exotic antiquity started. This conception has not died even now and
is represented by the works of the French Slavist A. Mazon  <a name="sik5text2"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note2">[+2]</a> and the Soviet
historian A.A. Zimin,  <a name="sik5text3"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note3">[+3]</a> whose book has not yet been published and therefore
cannot be considered. Third: the Lay is a text of ancient Russian literature,
but was composed after the twelfth century, an opinion put forward by
Sventsitskii and A. Vaillant  <a name="sik5text4"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note4">[+4]</a> who have proposed the fifteenth century as a
probable date, and D. N. Al'shits who relates it to the first half of the
thirteenth century.</p>
<p>The history of the question is so extensive  <a name="sik5text5"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note5">[+5]</a> that there is
no sense in reviewing it here; it is enough to note the upper limit of its
possible date. D.S. Likhachev has shown that the <i>Zadonshchina </i>[The Tale
of the Battle beyond the Don, which took place at Kulikovo in 1380 - tr.]
contains elements of borrowing from the Lay, so the Lay is older than the battle
of Kulikovo.  <a name="sik5text6"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note6">[+6]</a> Thus, all later dates fall away, but the very fact of the
discussion shows that the date, 1187 [accepted by Likhachev - tr.], gives rise
to doubt. Therefore, we propose new, additiona, material and a new approach.</p>
<p>In order not to duplicate what our predecessors have
achieved, we take as a basis the exhaustive commentary by D.S. Likhachev,  <a name="sik5text7"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note7">[+7]</a>
except for those instances when he leaves the question open. But as distinct
from a language-and-literature approach to the subject, we regard the content of
the text from the point of view of the likelihood of the events described in it.
In other words, we place the description of Igor's campaign on the canvas of
world history, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{287} </font></b>taking account of the
existing situation in the steppes of Mongolia and Desht-i-Kipchak. Finally, we
start from the fact that any literary work is written at a particular moment,
for a definite reason and is addressed to readers whom it should convince of
something. If we can understand for whom and for what the work we are concerned
with was written, then by a reverse thought process we shall find that single
moment which answers to the content and tendency of the work. And in this
context it is immaterial whether we are dealing with an invention, or a real
event which has passed through the prism of an author's creative thought. The
very creation of a literary work of genius and its influence on contemporary
readers is a fact within the competence of the historian.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Perplexity</h4>
<p>It is usually considered that the Lay of Igor's Host is a
patriotic work written in 1187 (p. 249), summoning the Russian princes to unity
(p. 252) and struggle against the Polovtsy, representatives of the steppe
culture foreign of Rus`. It is also supposed that this summons &quot;reached ...
those for whom it was intended&quot;, i.e. the apanage princes who organised an
anti-Polovtsy coalition in 1197 (pp. 267-8). This conception actually follows
from a literal understanding of the Lay and, therefore, at first glance seems
the only correct one. But we have only to compare the Lay not merely with one
set of facts, but to look at the text &quot;from the side&quot;, taking into
account a whole complex of events both in Rus` and in the contiguous lands, for
an exceedingly distressing perplexity immediately to arise.</p>
<p>First, the choice of the subject is strange. Igor`
Svyatoslavich's campaign was not caused by political necessity. Even in 1180
Igor was in close alliance with the Polovtsy; in 1184 he refused to take part in
a campaign against them, despite it being led by his Ol'govich cousin,
Svyatoslav Vsevolodovich, whom he had just put on the Kiev throne. And suddenly,
for no reason at all, he flings himself with his puny force into battle to gain
the whole steppe to the Black and Caspian Seas (pp. 243-4). It is also noted
that Igor did not agree about coordinating his actions even with the Kiev
prince. Naturally, the unprepared war ended in catastrophe, but, when the man
responsible for the calamity saves himself and goes to Kiev to pray to the
Pirogoshcha Virgin (p. 31), the whole country, instead <b><font COLOR="#943634">{288}
</font></b>of being justly indignant, rejoices and is gay, forgetting those
killed in battle and those left in captivity. Why ever?</p>
<p>It is quite obvious that the author of the Lay intended to
convey something important to his readers, not simply a tale of an unsuccessful
clash without any military or political significance. So the point of the Lay is
didactic, and the historical event is simply an excuse for the author to display
the ideas he wishes. D.S. Likhachev has noted (p. 240) the historicism of
ancient Russian literature which did not recognise invented subjects, so we
should not be surprised that a fact underlies the edification. It means that the
main point in the narrative is not the event described, but the conclusion drawn
from it, i.e. a hint about something completely clear to the
&quot;brethren&quot; to whom the author appealed and such as would prove it -
otherwise why write such a well thought out work? This hint is quite unclear to
us as twentieth-century readers, because the summons to war against the Polovtsy
had been made by Vladimir Monomakh in 1113 extremely simply, had been understood
by people and princes, also without difficulty, and in the early twelfth century
had become a generally recognised truth not evoking any doubts. But by the end
of the twelfth century this summons was not topical, because the predominance of
Rus` over the Polovtsy steppe had become self-evident. At that time the Polovtsy
had to a great extent been baptised  <a name="sik5text8"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note8">[+8]</a> and took part in internecine strife no
more than the Rurikid princes themselves, and always in alliance with one of the
Russian princes. To summon the people to mobilise at such a time is simply
stupid. But this is not all, the &quot;summons&quot; itself in retrospect evokes
no less doubt.</p>
<p>From the position that has been described, the author of the
Lay would have had a negative attitude to the princes who had brought the men of
foreign tribes against Rus`. The author does not spare his <b><font COLOR="#943634">{289}
</font></b>condemnation of Oleg Svyatoslavich, ascribing all the woes of the
Russian land to him. Yet, was he right? Oleg should have inherited the golden
throne of Kiev, but he was declared an outlaw, deprived of his position in the
succession or, as it was then called, the ladder, treacherously seized and with
the agreement of the Byzantine Emperor Nicephorus III (the usurper) and Vsevolod
I, prince of Kiev, sent into captivity on the island of Rhodes (1079). One may
think that the negative attitude to Oleg is explained by the fact that a year
before this he had gained his native Chernigov with the help of the Polovtsy and
then provoked the bloody clash at Nezhatina Niva on 3 October 1078 in which
another outlaw, Boris Vyacheslavich, and Isyaslav I, prince of Kiev, perished.
All right, but Oleg's antagonist, Vladimir Monomakh, had a year before this been
the first to bring the Polovtsy into Rus` in order to devastate the principality
of Polotsk. Why such disfavour towards Oleg?</p>
<p>Perhaps Oleg was not the first to turn for help to the
Polovtsy, but applied this help on a larger scale? Let us check. In the period
from 1128 to 1161 the descendants of Oleg brought the Polovtsy into Rus` fifteen
times,  <a name="sik5text9"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note9">[+9]</a> but Vladimir Monomakh alone had done this nineteen times.  <a name="sik5text10"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note10">[+10]</a> It seems
the question here is not a matter of historical fact, but rather of the very
adverse attitude of the author of the Lay towards Oleg. But why this attitude?</p>
<p>The enmity between Monomakh and Oleg over Chernigov had the
features usual in princely strife and did not call forth the bitter condemnation
of Russian society. Such an attitude, and a sharply negative one, towards Oleg
only appeared after 1095. Then Vladimir Monomakh lured the Polovtsy khan Itlar
for negotiations, treacherously killed him, butchered his suite and demanded
that Oleg Syatoslavich hand over War's son, a guest in Chernigov, to be killed.
Even in the twelfth century treachery was not regarded as a virtue in Rus`. Oleg
refused! Summoned to the Metropolitan's court, Oleg declared: &quot;I shall not
go for judgement to bishops, abbots and peasants&quot; [<i>smerd</i>].  <a name="sik5text11"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note11">[+11]</a> It
was after this, and only then, that Oleg was declared an enemy of the Russian
land and this became extended to his children as well.</p>
<p>This bad attitude to Oleg's descendants was not universal.
Rather, this was the platform of a group supporting prince Izyaslav <b><font COLOR="#943634">{290}
</font></b>Mstislavich and his son; but it is important for us that the author
of the Lay holds precisely this point of view.  <a name="sik5text12"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note12">[+12]</a> And it is not a question of
the nomads here. Both sides brought in as their allies Polovtsy and Torks and
Berendei, and even Muslim Bolgars. For example, in 1107 Vladimir Monomakh, Oleg
and David Svatoslavich simultaneously married their sons to Polovtsy women.
Nevertheless, there was a difference: Oleg and his children were friends with
the Polovtsy khans, but Monomakh and his descendants utilised them. The nuance
is very important for the time and it is impossible that the viewpoint of the
authors of the Hypatian Chronicle and of the Lay, who condemn Oleg, were the
only ones in Rus`. Evidently, there must have existed a Chernigov tradition
whitewashing Oleg. The Chernigov chronicle version has not come down to us, but
has been revealed by M. D. Priselkov as the &quot;third source of the Kievan
Grand Princely collation of 1200, used in extracts&quot;.  <a name="sik5text13"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note13">[+13]</a> Yet the author of
the Lay, in Priselkov's opinion, prefers the Kiev tradition, hostile to Oleg,
and his sympathies coincide with the Chernigov chronicle only in relation to
Igor` Svyatoslavich who in the Chernigov variant is called a &quot;faithful
prince&quot;. The contrast between Igor and his grandfather Oleg is striking. It
proceeds along two main lines: the attitude to the steppe and the attitude to
the Kiev Metropolitanate!</p>
<p>In fact, the enmity between the two princely groupings is not
only connected with Oleg Svyatoslavich's outlawry. After all, the town
population of the Seversk land took part in this enmity and without their
support the princely descendants of Oleg would not have been able to fight for
long. And here we approach the question, or more accurately the formulation of a
hypothesis which, if it is correct, will allow us to solve the question. The key
to the solution is contained in certain words in the text of the Lay of Igor's
Host and in the mutual relationship between Rus` and the steppe in the eleventh
to thirteenth centuries.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{291}</font></p>
<h4></b>An Unknown Land</h4>
<p>There is an opinion, widespread and even found in
schoolbooks, that the wild, nomad steppe was always opposed to the sedentary
culture of Rus` and struggled with it almost till the nineteenth century. Such
an over-generalisation is of itself strained, but the narrow-minded view derived
from it, that the steppe is a &quot;political&quot; and ethnic unity, is
completely inadmissible. Not for nothing did our twelfth-century ancestors name
the steppe the &quot;unknown land&quot;. This definition was applicable in later
ages, too.</p>
<p>First of all, even as regards physical geography the steppe
is more varied than the forest zone of Eurasia. The grassy steppes between the
Dnepr and the Don are unlike the dry Black Earths of the Caspian area or the Ryn
sands of the Volga-Ural interfluve. The river valleys and delta of the Volga are
in general azonal and do not fall within the general features of the arid zone,
neither do the foothills of the Caucasus and the shores of the Black Sea.
Different peoples lived in these different geographic conditions and were quite
unlike one another. This is how the ethnographic map of the &quot;unknown
land&quot; looked in the mid eleventh century.</p>
<p>The descendants of the Orthodox Khazars lived in the valleys
of the Don and the Terek, while their Muslim fellow-tribesmen inhabited the
delta and flood meadows of the Volga. The Yasy (Osetians) and Kasog (Cherkes)
dwelt in the Kuban area, not yet forced into the Caucasus mountains. The Goths-Tetraxites
kept the shores of the Black Sea. The Kama Bolgars controlled the left, the
steppe bank of the Volga, while the Mordva and Burtas held the right, high bank.
All these people were sedentary. Nomads occupied only the watersheds of the
steppes, but even they were not a single group. Torks, Berendei and Black Cowls
(Kara-Kalpak) pressed towards the Russian frontier, frightened of the genuine
steppe dwellers, the Polovtsy.</p>
<p>Russian-Polovtsy relations underwent a long evolution. In
1054 the Polovtsy appeared on the borders of Rus` as a conqueror people, drunk
from their victories over the Guz and Pechenegs. In 1068 they defeated the
Russian princes at the Al'ta and, it seemed, were close to conquering Eastern
Europe. The walls of the Russian fortresses, however, halted their onslaught and
until 1115 a stubborn war continued in which the Polovtsy tribal union made use
of the dissension among the Russian apanage princes. But the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{292}
</font></b>Polovtsy successes were ephemeral. As soon as Vladimir Monomakh
established internal peace, he transferred the war to the steppe and routed the
Polovtsy union. This was in essence the conquest of the steppe, though by no
means its subjugation, which in those times could not be achieved. The Polovtsy
entered into the system of the Kiev Principality just as, for example, the land
of Polotsk or Novgorod did, without losing its autonomy. They no longer took
part in the strife between the descendants of Oleg and Monomakh as an
independent force, but as auxiliary troops. They did not dare to stand out
against Rus` as a whole, so it is more correct to speak of a unified Russian-Polovtsy
system which replaced the former opposition. That is why the Russian princes
took the part of the Polovtsy in 1223, which led to Mongol perplexity and Batu's
campaign which followed in 1236. Igor's campaign in 1186 is not in the general
style of Russian-Polovtsy twelfth-century relations and so, evidently, it was
given particular attention by the authors of the Hypatian Chronicle and the Lay.
 <a name="sik5text14"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note14">[+14]</a> We shall speak about the causes of this heightened interest in another
connection.</p>
<p>So, from the fall of the Khazar kaganate in 965 to the
founding of the Golden Horde in 1241 no steppe unity existed and there was no
danger to the Russian land from the steppe. Yet the Lay of Igor's Host is imbued
with quite another mood and this leads to the thought that the author of our
source had something in mind about which he preferred not to speak directly.
This suspicion makes us return again to the text and focus on certain
orientalisms which have not had adequate explanation. In this we abandon in
advance all preconceived opinions so as to stand firmly on undoubted fact.</p>
<font SIZE="3">
<p></p>
</font>
<h4>Khin</h4>
<p>The mysterious name <i>khin </i>is mentioned three times in
the Lay. D.S. Likhachev judged this as &quot;some unknown eastern peoples,
rumours of whom could reach Byzantium even from the most eastern peoples by word
of mouth and through oral literature&quot; (p. 429). But there was no people
with this name!  <a name="sik5text15"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note15">[+15]</a> Moreover, the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{293} </font></b>Khin
are mentioned as neighbours of Rus`. Igor's defeat &quot;gave boldness to the
Khin&quot; (p. 20). The warriors of the two west Russian princes, Roman of Volyn`
and Mstislav of Gorodno, are a threat for the &quot;Khin&quot; and the
Lithuanian tribes (p. 23). And finally, the &quot;Khin arrows&quot; in
Yaroslavna's lament is an image completely clear to the readers of the Lay. So,
this term was well known in Rus`. The only word corresponding to these three
quotations is the name of the Jurchen empire, the Kin (present day reading Jin,
&quot;Golden') (1115-1234).  <a name="sik5text16"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note16">[+16]</a> The replacing of <i>k </i>by <i>kh </i>shows
that this word was brought to Rus` by the Mongols who have no <i>k </i>sound in
their language.  <a name="sik5text17"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note17">[+17]</a> But then the information is not from the twelfth century,
but the thirteenth, no earlier than the battle on the Kalka in 1223, and
probably later than 1234; and this is why.</p>
<p>The Kin Empire claimed dominance over the eastern half of the
Great Steppe up to the Altai and regarded the tribal powers existing there as
their vassals. This suzerainty was by no means real, but juridical, and the
Kerait, Mongol and Tatar tribes were considered political subjects of the
empire, i.e. as Kin, though not as Jurchen. Such a conventional designation was
exceedingly widespread in Asia. Thus, the Mongols prior to Chinggiskhan were
called Tatars since the Tatar tribe was the leader in the steppe. Then the
tribes conquered by Chinggiskhan began to be called Mongols or, according to the
old memory, Tatars, and this name was attached to the group of Volga Turks.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth century the name <i>Khin </i>was attached
to the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{294} </font></b>Golden Horde Tatars. In the <i>Zadonshchina
</i>it is explained that &quot;on the east, the lot of Shem, son of Noah, from
him are descended the Khin, the pagan Tatars, the Busurman. At the river Kayala
they overcame the clan of Japhet. And since then the Russian land is sad
...&quot; Mamai's officer is called a <i>Khin </i>and, finally, it is said that:
&quot;the steel swords rang against the Khin helmets on the field of Kulikovo&quot;.
 <a name="sik5text18"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note18">[+18]</a></p>
<p>To understand the history of Asia we have to fully assimilate
that nationalities and national names did not exist there until the twentieth
century. Therefore, after the Jurchen empire had been conquered by the Mongols,
the latter continued to be called Khin in the political, but not the ethnic
sense of the word. However, this name was replaced by new political names:
Mongol and Yuan. It could continue alongside them as applied to the Mongols only
in the middle of the thirteenth century. But then it means that by the Khin we
should understand the Mongol Tatars of the Golden Horde and, consequently, the
subject of the Lay is itself no more than a code. Yes: such is our guess and the
otherwise inexplicable Russian name of the Blue [Sinyaya] Horde- the Golden
Horde - speaks for it. This is a literal translation of the Chinese word Kin
(now, Jin).  <a name="sik5text19"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note19">[+19]</a> And this name evidently arose because Batu's troops were made up
to strength with Jurchen who had surrendered just as Kubilai's forces were
supplemented with Russians and Polovtsy. Based on this consideration, we may
guess what the reference in the text of the Lay to &quot;Khin arrows&quot;
means.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{295}</font></p>
<h4></b>Khin Arrows</h4>
<p>In the middle ages arrows were in short supply. It is not
easy to make a good arrow and they were rapidly expended. Therefore, it is clear
that after seizing the Jurchen arsenals the Mongols had ensured a supply of
arrows for a certain time. For the author of the Lay, just as for his readers,
Khin, i.e. Mongol, arrows were a quite specific concept. What is the secret?</p>
<p>The arrows of the Far Eastern peoples were distinguished by
the fact that they were sometimes poisoned. This was never noted by contemporary
chroniclers because the Mongols kept their military secrets. An analysis of
fragments from the Concealed Tale, though, shows that those wounded by arrows
were given milk to drink after the wound had first been sucked clean. It seems
that a snake poison was used which was not absorbed by the gut walls, so it
could be swallowed without harm. Sucking the wound in good time and giving a few
drops of milk were considered life-saving.</p>
<p>In preparing for the campaign against the Merkit, Jamuqa
says: &quot;I have made ready my notched arrows&quot;.  <a name="sik5text20"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note20">[+20]</a> Why should an arrow
have notches? They complicate their preparation very much but do not increase
their military advantage. There could only be one use for the notches: the arrow
can be held longer in the wound and this is particularly important if the arrow
is poisoned.</p>
<p>Somewhat later our source confirms this guess. &quot;In
battle Chinggiskhan was wounded in an artery in the neck. It was impossible to
stop the blood and he was in the grip of fever [a symptom of poisoning - L.G.].
At sunset they disposed themselves for the night in sight of the enemy, on the
battlefield. Jelme was all the time sucking out the coagulating blood (the first
and main cure for snake poison - L.G.). With bloodied mouth he sat by the sick
man, trusting no one to replace him. Gathering a mouthful, now he swallowed it,
now he spat it out. After midnight Chinggiskhan regained consciousness and said:
&quot;I am thirsty, my blood has quite dried up.&quot; Then Jelme threw off
everything, both cap and shoes and outer clothing, remaining only in his
underclothes; almost bare, he set off at a run straight into the enemy camp
opposite. In a vain search for kumis [milk, an antidote - L.G.], he clambers
onto the Tayichi'ut waggons surrounding the camp. Hurriedly running away they
had <b><font COLOR="#943634">{296} </font></b>left their mares unmilked. Finding
no kumis he took an enormous horn of sour milk from some waggon and brought
it...&quot;</p>
<p>Bringing the horn of sour milk, Jelme himself runs for water,
brings it, dilutes the sour milk and gives it to the khan to drink [so, water
was close by, but he had to get milk, though at risk to his life - L.G.].
&quot;Thrice taking breath, he drank and said: &quot;My inner eye has
cleared&quot; [It helped! - L.G.]. Meanwhile, it grew light and, looking around,
Chinggiskhan noticed the dirty phlegm resulting from Jelme hawking up the <i>blood
he had sucked out </i>[&quot;my italics&quot; - L.G.] to all sides. &quot;What
is this? Could you not have gone and spat a bit further off?&quot; he said. Then
Jelme said to him: &quot;You were very chilled and I was frightened of leaving
you, fearing you might become worse. Everything occurred hurriedly: if you
swallow, you swallow; if you spit, you spit. From worry a fair amount went in my
belly&quot; [Jelme hints that he swallowed the filth for the khan's sake - L.G.].</p>
<p>&quot;But why&quot;, continued Chinggiskhan, &quot;did you
run naked to the enemy when I lay in such a state?&quot; &quot;What I
thought&quot;, said Jelme, &quot;what I thought was to run naked to the enemy.
If they seized me, I would say to them: I thought of fleeing to you, but our
people guessing that, seized me and intended to kill me. They undressed me and
had already started to pull off my last trousers when I managed to run away to
you. That is what I would have told them. I am sure they would have believed me,
given me clothes and accepted me. But would I not have returned to you on the
first horse I found? Only so could I assuage the thirst of my sovereign, I
thought, and in the twinkling of an eye I decided&quot; [again, it is not a
question of thirst, but of an antidote, since thirst is better quenched by
water, not milk - L.G.]. Then Chinggiskhan said to him: &quot;What shall I say
to you? Once, when the Merkit descended on us, you saved my life for the first
time. Now, you have again saved my life, sucking out the drying [more exactly,
the gushing or dying - L.G.] blood, and again when I was chilled and parched,
disregarding the danger to your life, in the twinkling of an eye you went into
the enemy camp and, quenching my thirst, restored me to life [sucking out the
blood and the few drops of milk are considered life-saving and on a par with the
unparalleled heroic defence of Burkhan mountain - L.G.]. May these services of
yours remain in my memory&quot; Thus he was pleased to speak&quot;.  <a name="sik5text21"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note21">[+21]</a></p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{297} </font></b>Another episode is no
less characteristic. After a fight with the Kerait &quot;... Boroqul and Ogedei.
They rode up. Blood was streaming from the corners of Boroqul's mouth. It turns
out that Ogedei was wounded by an arrow in a neck vertebra, and Boroqul was all
the time sucking the blood out and so the blood he had taken flowed from the
corners of his mouth ... Chinggiskhan immediately ordered a fire to be lit, the
wound to be cauterised and Ogedei given drink.&quot;  <a name="sik5text22"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note22">[+22]</a> Later the description
of Boroqul's feat is repeated and it is stressed that the timely sucking of the
blood had saved Ogedei's life.</p>
<p>I imagine that in both cases the picture of poisoning is
undoubted, and one can even determine what poison was used. It is known that
vegetable alkaloid poisons operate very quickly, but here we have a slow acting
poison against which sucking and cauterising is effective. Such is snake poison.
It could be supplied from vipers which are abundant in the Trans-Baikal area.
The method of obtaining this poison is very simple, it is squeezed out of the
viper's fangs onto a plate. The dried venom can be kept as long as required and
put to use after being dissolved in water. As snake poison is not absorbed by
the stomach, it is not dangerous to suck out the blood. It seems only arrows
were poisoned, since Quyuldar the Mangqut, wounded with a spear, only died when
hunting because his wound opened from his galloping. The source gives no
indication of poison.</p>
<p>In earlier periods among the Turks and Uighurs, weapons were
not poisoned, since the Chinese chroniclers, well informed until the ninth
century, and exceedingly attentive to their competitors` war technology, give
only one completely specific case. The Turkic kagan Silibi Li-Simo, favourite of
the [Tang] emperor Taizon [626-49] (Li Shi-min), was accidentally wounded by an
arrow while on campaign in Korea and the emperor personally sucked his blood
out.  <a name="sik5text23"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note23">[+23]</a></p>
<p>This last case gives us the chance to trace where the steppe
nomads borrowed the use of poisoned arrows from. The Mokhe or Ugi, their
northern neighbours, living along the shores of the Sungari, fought on the side
of the Koreans. These were descendants of the ancient Sushen and ancestors of
the Jurchen. The <i>Bei shi </i>says of them: &quot;they use a bow 3 feet long
and arrows 1.2 feet. Usually in the seventh and eighth month they make poison
and rub it on <b><font COLOR="#943634">{298} </font></b>their arrows to shoot
animals and birds. Wounded they quickly die.&quot;  <a name="sik5text24"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note24">[+24]</a> It is characteristic that
the bow is small and cannot have been powerful and that the arrow is not long
and not heavy so that its penetration was insignificant. The poison alone gives
the whole effect.  <a name="sik5text25"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note25">[+25]</a> Another detail is no less important: the poison was
prepared in autumn. The strength of snake venom varies according to the time of
year; it is most dangerous in autumn.</p>

<h4>A Few More Words</h4>
<p>A comparable example to the word Khin is the frequently
encountered word <i>kharlug </i>which the commentator explains as sword-steel <i>(bulat)
</i>(p. 406). The Mongolisation of Turkic words we noted above gives us the
right to see here the word <i>karaluk, </i>the <i>k </i>(Turkic) being replaced
by <i>kh </i>(Mongol), i.e. blue steel.  <a name="sik5text26"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note26">[+26]</a> The interpretation proposed does not
contradict the established one, but the suffix <i>lug </i>instead of <i>hk </i>deserves
attention. Such a pronunciation is a feature of archaic Turkic dialects of the
pre-Mongol period and for the thirteenth century; for example, Kuchlug
&quot;strong&quot;, the name of the Naiman prince.  <a name="sik5text27"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note27">[+27]</a> The suffix <i>lug </i>occurs
in the Orkhon inscriptions  <a name="sik5text28"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note28">[+28]</a> and in an eighth-century Tibetan geographic
treatise.  <a name="sik5text29"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note29">[+29]</a></p>
<p>The regular occurrence of the phonetic transcription we have
noted allows us to make one more deduction showing the Lay to be older than the <i>Zadonshchina.
</i>In the <i>Zadonshchina </i>the word <i>katun </i>(&quot;lady&quot;,
metaphorically &quot;mistress') is adduced with a Turkic sound,  <a name="sik5text30"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note30">[+30]</a> <b><font COLOR="#943634">{299}
</font></b>in Mongolian it would be <i>qatun. </i>In the fourteenth century
Turkic replaced Mongol in the Volga area and the Russian author wrote the word
as he heard it. But the author of the Lay heard analogous words from the
Mongols: that means he wrote no later and no earlier than the thirteenth
century.</p>
<p>The meaning of the mysterious word <i>Deremela, </i>according
to D.S. Likhachev, is unclear (p. 446). A.S. Solov'ev's proposed explanation is
that &quot;Deremela is probably the Yatvag region and the Yatvag tribe Dernen,
Derme&quot;  <a name="sik5text31"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note31">[+31]</a> is too strained, especially since the Yatvag are mentioned
alongside. But there is the Mongol personal name Darmala, frequent in
Chinggiskhan's period. In Persian notation this will be &lt;iL╩&gt;f which with
eastern pronunciation reads as <i>tarmala, </i>and with western as <i>teremele </i>which
corresponds to the one we are seeking. If we imagine that among those defeated
by Roman and Mstislav there was the detachment of a Mongol baskak called Darmala,
in charge of a region between the Yatvag country and the Polovtsy steppe, no
contradiction between phonetics and text arises. Among nomads an ethnic name is
often replaced by the name of a leader; for example the Seljuks were the
partisans of and subordinates to Seljuk. Therefore, we can suppose that it is
not a people that figures here, but simply the men and district subordinate to
Darmala. But this again takes us to the thirteenth century and, as we have no
full explanation yet for what we have observed, let us refrain from conclusions
and continue the search.</p>

<h4>Troyan and Div</h4>
<p>The mysterious personage Troyan is mentioned four times in
the Lay of Igor's Host. The literature on this word or term is enormous, but,
fortunately, it has been reduced to a comprehensible system by N.S. Derzhavin.
 <a name="sik5text32"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note32">[+32]</a> He isolated four trends in interpreting the word Troyan: (1) mythological (Buslaev,
Kvashin-Samarin, Barsov): Troyan is a Slavonic pagan deity; (2) symbolic (Polevoi,
Bodyanskii, Zabelin, Potebnya, Kostomarov): Troyan is a philosophical and
literary image; (3) historical and literary (Vyazemskii, Vs. Miller, N.
Veselovskii, Pypin): common to this trend is a denial of Troyan as a personage
of ancient Russian <b><font COLOR="#943634">{300} </font></b>thought; a
borrowing of the image from Byzantine and south Slavonic traditions either of
the Trojan War or simply a passion for &quot;old words found by the author of
the Lay in old Bulgarian books&quot; (Vs. Miller); (4) historical (Drinov,
Maksimovich, Dashkevich et al.): Troyan is either the emperor Trajan, or Russian
princes personified into a deity. This scheme is of interest for the history of
the question, but to make sense of the subject itself is too confused and
amorphous.</p>
<p>A. Boldur's classification,  <a name="sik5text33"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note33">[+33]</a> separating out three variants
of the hypothesis now current, is much clearer: (1) Troyan is the Roman emperor
Trajan; (2) Troyan is a Slavonic deity; (3) Troyan are the Russian eleventh- to
twelfth-century princes (a triumvirate): Kiev, Chernigov, Pereyaslavl`. The last
variant is not worth looking at seriously.</p>
<p>Boldur gives a criticism of these views in his article and
puts forward his own original hypothesis: Troyan is the name of the emperor
Trajan transferred to the legendary king Midas by the south Slavs who have a
tale similar to the myth of Midas and his ass's ears. Without going into an
analysis of the hypothesis in the section concerning the folklore of the Balkan
Slavs, we should note that this throws no light at all on the mention of Troyan
in the context of the Lay of Igor's Host, whether taking the historical
circumstances of the event described (Igor's campaign and rout) into account, or
not. It suffices to note that from this point of view the &quot;land of Troyan&quot;
is Romania, while the Lay tells us that &quot;offence entered the Troyan
land&quot; because of the Polovtsy counter-raid when the town of Rimov was burnt
and Putivl` besieged. But the &quot;landmarks/centuries of Troyan&quot; are
inevitably taken as a literary metaphor without semantic load.  <a name="sik5text34"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note34">[+34]</a> While
recognising the historiographic value of Boldur's article, we should acknowledge
D.S. Likhachev's historical commentary to his edition of the Lay of Igor's Host
as the sum of scholarly research.</p>
<p>Likhachev's exhaustive analysis shows that this name is that
of a deity, which is, he believes, pagan (pp. 385-6). It is certainly not an
Orthodox one. But let us not rush the conclusion. Troyan is mentioned not only
in the Lay, but in The Virgin's Journey through Purgatory (twelfth century) in
this context.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{301} </font></b>'They [the pagans -
L.G.] named all the gods. Sun and moon, earth and water, animals, vermin <i>tosetneyu
</i>(?!) and human names, namely: Troyan, Khors, Veles, Perun they turned into
gods, believing in evil devils.&quot; The text is puzzling and its meaning was
lost in ancient times, for in the Tale On the Revelation of the Holy Apostles
(sixteenth century) the maxim on the pagan deities appears differently:
&quot;and many men have understood and would not enter into great deceit,
recognising many gods: Perun and Khors, Dyi and Troyan and many others, for the
men were elders: Perun in Greece, Khors in Cyprus, Troyan was king in
Rome&quot;.  <a name="sik5text35"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note35">[+35]</a> Thus, in the opinion of the sixteenth-century author, paganism
is the deification of kings, but according to the twelfth-century author it was
the forces of nature. The first interpretation can be rejected both because D.S.
Likhachev has shown that Troyan in the Lay of Igor's Host does not relate to the
emperor Trajan, and also because the sixteenth-century author displayed a lack
of understanding of the deities` names he had himself selected and he separated
Perun, the god of thunder, i.e. Zeus, from his name in another case, <i>Dyi. </i> <a name="sik5text36"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note36">[+36]</a>
Yet, accepting the twelfth-century text as a basis, we encounter a glaring
contradiction in those features which the Lay of Igor's Host gives to Troyan.</p>
<p>Let us sort out the texts. In the first case, the follower of
Troyan is called Boyan (pp. 11,78) who &quot;raced along Troyan's path through
the fields into the mountains&quot;. This last expression is explained by D.S.
Likhachev as &quot;borne away in imagination over enormous distances&quot; (p.
78). But let us try to understand it literally, i.e. to consider that the source
of belief in Troyan lies in mountains beyond fields. The fields in this case are
the Polovtsy steppes, and the mountains are either the Caucasus, or the eastern
border of the Kipchak steppe, the Tianshan. Well, a suitable place for deifying
the devil!</p>
<p>In the second case, the &quot;land of Troyan&quot; is named
where, after a defeat, &quot;offence entered&quot; (p. 17). It is considered
that this is the Russian land; but here, rather, is the Chernigov principality
which alone suffered from the Polovtsy counter-raid. Here a question arises: why
is an &quot;evil devil&quot; the protector of an Orthodox <b><font COLOR="#943634">{302}
</font></b>principality? It is evident that the author of The Virgin's Journey
through Purgatory and the author of the Lay had diametrically opposed attitudes
to Troyan. Why? The texts give no answer. Let us turn to the facts.</p>
<p>In the 1060s, two sorcerers appeared in Yaroslavl` denouncing
women, mainly rich ones, as responsible for a famine. Moreover, they took grain
or fish from their backs and themselves took the property of those killed. The
simple trick was a success with the people - about 300 adherents gathered around
the sorcerers. With the aid of twelve squires the boyar Yan Vyshatich was able
to disperse the crowd and seize the sorcerers. These demanded that they be sent
for justice to prince Svyatoslav Yaroslavich of Chernigov, for they were his
dependants. They evidently hoped for Svyatoslav's intercession, but the boyar
Yan Vyshatich feared this and so gave them to the relatives of the slaughtered
women. The sorcerers were killed and a bear ate the corpses. Does this episode
relate to the deity Troyan? From the point of view of the author of The Virgin's
Journey it seems it does, and the Chernigov prince is indirectly named as being
to blame for the disturbance. But from the position of the author of the Lay,
absolutely not, as is clear from the further mentions of this strange deity. For
the time, let us note that even in ancient Rus` there was no conformity of views
about Troyan.</p>
<p>Troyan's enemy, Div, appears in the part of the &quot;evil
devil&quot; in the mouth of the singer of the heroic feats of the Novgorod-Seversk
prince, great-grandson of Svyatoslav Yaroslavich mentioned above; this was the
name by which educated Persians called the deities of their opponents, the
Turanian nomads. In common speech this word sounded like Dev.</p>
<p>According to the Lay of Igor's Host, Div at first warns
prince Igor's enemies of the campaign being undertaken (p. 12), then along with
the furious Polovtsy he invades the Russian land (p. 20), i.e. he behaves as
Troyan would behave were he a heathen deity for the Chernigov man. But the
author of the Lay has not simply sympathy for Troyan, but esteem, because an era
is linked with him, i.e. a linear count of time, like the <i>Hijra </i>with the
Muslims. First, Troyan's <i>vechi </i>(i.e. <i>veka </i>centuries) are
mentioned, which preceded the time of Yaroslav the Wise (p. 15); second, when
they began, i.e. where the count is made from is indicated: &quot;In the seventh
century of Troyan&quot; Vseslav, prince of Polotsk, struck with the shaft of his
spear against the golden throne of Kiev (p. 25) - made an attempt <b><font COLOR="#943634">{303}
</font></b>to seize the throne of Rus`. This took place in 1068. This was
approximately when Yan Vyshatich dealt with the sorcerers, the dependants of the
Chernigov prince. Yet the author of The Journey of the Virgin through Purgatory
can scarcely have been right to call Troyan a devil; or more accurately he and
the author of the Lay called different things by one name.</p>
<p>Now let us compare Troyan's features with the data we possess
about the Nestorians of east central Asia. Let us suppose that Troyan is a
literal translation of the concept of the Trinity, but not from Greek and not by
a Russian translator, but by a man in his own language in which the category of
gender is lacking. That is, this is a translation of the term <i>ug iduk </i>made
by a Turk into Russian. We may conclude that the translator made no attempt to
stress the identity of Troyan and Trinity. For him these concepts did not fully
coincide, although he underestood that both related to Christianity. But the
dissension and enmity between the Nestorians and the Chalcedonites in the
twelfth to thirteenth centuries were so great that the Russian princes killed
the Tatar Nestorian emissaries in 1223;  <a name="sik5text37"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note37">[+37]</a> after this the Nestorian clergy
refused communion to the Orthodox, although Catholics were admitted to the
Eucharist.</p>
<p>The start of &quot;Troyan's era&quot; falls in the period
when the Nestorian creed was condemned at the Council of Ephesus in 431 and
again anathematised there in 449 (the Robber Synod). Finally, an anathema of the
stubborn Nestorians was pronounced at the Council of Chalcedon in 451. They were
only able to avoid repression by renouncing their teacher, against whom the
Orthodox and Monophysites united in struggle. In 482 the Emperor Zeno issued the
edict Enotikon which contained concessions to the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{304}
</font></b>Monophysites and confirmed the anathema of the Nestorians who were
compelled to emigrate to Persia.  <a name="sik5text38"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note38">[+38]</a> The date from which the &quot;centuries of
Troyan&quot; are counted lies in the interval between the Councils of Ephesus
and Chalcedon. That date could only be of significance for Nestorians.</p>
<p>Let us turn to the expression the &quot;land of Troyan&quot;
(p. 17). The Chernigov principality stood apart from the Russian land after Oleg
Svyatoslavich, the outlaw prince, had driven Vladimir Monomakh from Chernigov
and assured his family of the right to rule. By this he came into conflict not
only with the princely descendants of Monomakh, but also with the Kiev
metropolitan see.  <a name="sik5text39"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note39">[+39]</a> In order to remain on the throne he needed both a military
and an ideological base. In an analogous situation the Polotsk princes found
support in pagan traditions, but this was impossible in the south since the
principalities of Kiev and Chernigov had been Christianised.  <a name="sik5text40"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note40">[+40]</a> In this regard,
the situation of Oleg Svyatoslavich was extremely difficult: the Orthodox
Khazars seized him, the Orthodox Greeks kept him in prison, the Orthodox princes
Izyaslav and Vsevolod plundered his lands and drove him from his native home,
the Metropolitan of Kiev wanted to bring him to court; should he not seek
another variant of the Christian faith? And then his friend (&quot;though of
Oleg the Kagan&quot;, p. 30) Boyan found a way &quot;through the fields into the
mountains&quot; (p. 11) where real Christians and the enemies of Oleg's enemies
lived. It is very natural to suppose that the Chernigov prince did not neglect
this opportunity and this caused the enmity of the Kievans to his children
Vsevolod and Igor`. An open split, it seems, did not occur. The matter was
limited to tolerance of eastern merchants, and perhaps even monks, to sympathy
for them, as we would say - to a penchant towards Nestorianism. Therefore,
information about the prince who was second in importance in Rus` deviating into
heresy did not get into official documents, but the course of events is
explained in this regard, as well as the obscure fragments of the Lay we have
adduced above.</p>
<p>Now let us compare the features of Div  <a name="sik5text41"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note41">[+41]</a> with the
description of the Mongol Black Faith as perceived by a thirteenth-century <b><font COLOR="#943634">{305}
</font></b>Russian. &quot;Chingizakon's foul imaginings, his blood drinking,
much [wizardry], the kings and princes and grandees coming to worship the sun
and moon, and the earth, the devil, and their dead fathers in hell, and their
grandfathers, and their mothers, by going round a bush; Oh, their foul
delight.&quot;  <a name="sik5text42"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note42">[+42]</a></p>
<p>As we have already encountered the thirteenth-century Mongol
deities, it is easy to identify them. The concepts differentiated are separated
by &quot;and&quot;, but there is no &quot;and&quot; in the expression
&quot;earth-devil&quot;. It seems that in modern style we would write it
&quot;earth devil&quot;. But Russians of the thirteenth century had an adequate
conception of the devil and never confused him with anything else. In the Lay,
this is Div, but is certainly not Troy an.</p>
<p>So we have approached a solution. Nestorianism was so well
known in thirteenth-century Rus` that the reader of the Lay did not need
detailed explanations, but caught the author's thought from his hints. At the
same time it makes a pair with the deity of the Black Faith, i.e. the
ideological situation of the Golden Horde at the time of Batu is reproduced in
flowing strokes. Under Berke it changed fundamentally. The author of the Lay
evidently understood theological questions. But since we, too, are aware of the
dogma and cosmology of the Black Faith, we can try to interpret one more poetic
image in the Lay - the &quot;imaginary tree&quot;.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Imaginary Tree</h4>
<p>As we have seen above, the &quot;tree&quot; in the Black
Faith is an image of a &quot;means of communicating&quot; with the upper and
lower worlds or the &quot;immanency of other being&quot;. In the Lay it is
mentioned twice: the wise Boyan ranged over it in thought when he intended to
compose his verses. In other words, this is inspiration, but not only
inspiration. Here two planes of existence are recalled: the upper where he had
to fly &quot;like a grey eagle under the clouds&quot;, and the middle where he
could move &quot;like a grey wolf over the land&quot; (p. 9). The lower world is
omitted, for to Boyan the land of devils is irrelevant. The vertical movement is
carried out by &quot;thought&quot; (p. 9) or &quot;hopping <b><font COLOR="#943634">{306}
</font></b>like a nightingale through the imaginary tree, flying in mind under
the clouds&quot; (p. 11), i.e. in no real way. The nightingale is accepted by
D.S. Likhachev. But let us recall that a bird in shamanist symbolism is the
soul.  <a name="sik5text43"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note43">[+43]</a> We have to consider the symbol was the same in the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>Thus, the author of the Lay, in ascribing to Boyan the
ability to create, interprets the mechanism of the process in a manner accepted
in Eastern Siberia and Mongolia. This is hardly a chance coincidence. Rather,
the author himself and his readers were well acquainted with Far Eastern symbols
which they could only have learnt from the Mongols.  <a name="sik5text44"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note44">[+44]</a></p>
<p>But if all our observations, or even one of them, are right,
it means the author of the Lay while saying one thing intended quite another. In
doing this, did he hoodwink his contemporary readers? Hardly. &quot;The uttered
thought is, of course, false&quot; - but in what sense? Conscious deception or,
in today's expression, disinformation is far from the same as poetic forms of
allegory. Most likely, his contemporaries understood their poet, but we,
accustomed to literalism, miss something important. This, of course, is natural,
since the text of the Lay was not written for us who have been brought up on
such estimable legislators of style as Brokgauz [i.e. Brockhaus] and Efron
[publishers of the main pre-Soviet encyclopedia - trans.].  <a name="sik5text45"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note45">[+45]</a></p>
<p>What is to be done now? Perhaps the best thing is to stop
discussing words and to pass to an analysis of the twelfth- to
thirteenth-century events, both those mentioned in the Lay of Igor's Host and
remaining outside it.</p>
<b>
<h4><font COLOR="#943634">{307}</font></h4>
<h4></b>Kayala and Kalka</h4>
<p>Thus our research has led us to date the Lay of Igor's Host
more probably in the thirteenth century, but priority in this area belongs toD N
Al'shits who adduced proof that the Lay was written after 1202  <a name="sik5text46"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note46">[+46]</a> In addition,
we may assume that the author was acquainted with the Hypatian Chronicle which
was compiled in 1200  <a name="sik5text47"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note47">[+47]</a> D.N. Al'shits also suggested that the Lay was written
after the first defeat of the Russian princes on the Kalka, i.e. after 1223
&quot;based on the fact that the course of events in the battles on the Kayala
and the Kalka was extremely similar&quot; One should agree with this, but
Al'shits's upper limit, 1237, &quot;after which this passionate appeal for unity
would have been senseless&quot;, cannot be, since it precludes answering M.D.
Priselkov's justified question. The historian must not stop at the fact that
only one episode in the one-and-a-half-century struggle of Rus` with the
Polovtsy steppe, Igor's unsuccessful campaign in 1185, for some reason attracted
such intense attention from contemporaries why did this summons resound?
Evidently, the tale of the military episode in 1185 in its day touched on some
weighty and disturbing themes of life at the time. The main task of the
historian is to disclose these themes&quot;.  <a name="sik5text48"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note48">[+48]</a></p>
<p>Let us begin with an argument the &quot;senseless&quot;
summons to struggle against the steppe dwellers was not after, but before 1237.
The Polovtsy were in alliance with the Russians, and the Mongols were tied down
by a war in the Far East which ended in May 1234, and a war in the Near East
which continued till 1261. For as long as the Far Eastern war tied down the
Mongol forces there was no danger to Rus`, and no one could foresee the Mongol
victory Apart from that, the Russians had no conception of Far Eastern affairs
until they started to go to Karakorum to pay their respects. An author of the
early thirteenth century had even less cause to be alarmed about the steppe
dwellers than a twelfth-century author, because the question of a campaign to
the west was decided at a special kuriltai in the summer of 1235.</p>
<p>On the other hand, a call to unify the princes against their
eastern neighbours was completely topical in the 1240s. Two campaigns, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{308}
</font></b>won by the Mongols in 1237-8 and 1240, had not greatly reduced the
Russian war potential.  <a name="sik5text49"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note49">[+49]</a> For example, in Great Rus` the towns of Ryazan`,
Vladimir and the small ones of Suzdal`, Torzhok and Kozel'sk had suffered. Other
towns capitulated and were spared. The rural population dispersed through the
forests and waited until the enemy left; of course, the number of Mongols -
300,000 - is the usual tenfold exaggeration of eastern authors. In the whole of
Mongolia there were not that many troops, and for the Mongols Rus` was a
third-stage front (after China and Iran). The very transfer of so many people
from Mongolia to the Volga in only one year would have been technically
unrealisable. Three hundred thousand horsemen would need no less than a million
horses and they could not go in a single line. If we suppose they went in
echelons, the second would not find grazing. The Mongols were unable to find
reinforcements in the Aral steppes, since, first, the population there was
sparse, second, it was hostile to the Mongols, and third, it had fled from the
Yaik to the Volga under Mongol pressure in 1229. The Polovtsy and Alans drew off
about a quarter of the Mongol army, the detachment of Mongke which had joined
Batu beneath the walls of Kiev only in 1240. Apart from that, not all the
Russian principalities suffered defeat. Smolensk, Polotsk, Lutsk and the whole
of Black Rus` [roughly the area between the upper reaches of the Neman and of
the Narev - trans.] were untouched by the Mongols. The Novgorod republic as
well. In brief, there were any amount of forces to continue the war; the only
important thing was to persuade the princes and for some reason they were hard
to persuade.</p>
<p>Finally, although the course of events in the battles on the
Kayala and the Kalka do in fact coincide, there is a difference. Igor did not
kill the Polovtsy emissaries as the princes had done in 1223. Moreover, it is
very relevant that the first emissaries, the Nestorian Christians, were killed,
but afterwards the pagan emissaries were released unharmed. In the thirteenth
century this was undoubtedly known, at least to readers of the Lay of Igor's
Host. If we accept D. N. Al'shits's proposed concept of an allegory, we should
also take account of the silence which was to be understood as a hint. If, in
speaking of 1185, the author implied the first action of the Russians against
the Mongols and was making a call for further struggle with them, it means that
he considered the killing of the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{309} </font></b>Nestorians
right, and here is concealed that hidden meaning which was clear only to the
politicians and warriors of the thirteenth century. At that time this was,
perhaps, a very sore point, because the Mongols explained their war against Rus`
as vengeance for the killing of their emissaries Hungary was put to the sword
for the same reasons, but not the cautious Nicaean empire where the Mongol
emissaries were received with respect.</p>
<p>Batu's breath-taking campaign from the Aral Sea to the
Adriatic put the whole of Eastern Europe in the power of the Mongols and one
might have thought that all was finished for Orthodoxy. But circumstances
transpired in such a way that events followed another course.</p>
<p>During his campaign, Batu quarrelled with his cousin, Guyuk,
son of the supreme khan Ogedei himself, and Bun, son of Chagatai, the great
guardian of the Yasa. Their fathers sided with Batu and punished their over-bold
sons by declaring them disgraced, but when Ogedei died in 1241 and power fell
into the hands of the queen Toregena, Guyuk's mother, Guyuk's and Bun's
followers were recalled, and poor Batu was left holding an enormous country with
only 4,000 faithful troops and with extremely tense relations with the central
government. There could be no question of holding the conquered territories by
force Return to Mongolia meant a more or less cruel death. Then Batu, an
intelligent and far-sighted man, entered on a policy of making overtures to his
subjects, in particular the Russian princes Yaroslav Vsevolodovich and his son,
Aleksandr Their lands were not subject to tribute.  <a name="sik5text50"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note50">[+50]</a></p>
<p>Guyuk, too, was not having an easy time. The Mongol veterans,
the comrades in arms of his grandfather, and the Nestorians connected with
Tolui's children, rose against him Although Guyuk was proclaimed great khan in
1246, he had no real base Guyuk tried to find one where his brother Batu had,
among the Orthodox population of the conquered lands. He invited &quot;clergy
from Sham (Syria), Rum (Byzantium), Osov and Rus`,  <a name="sik5text51"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note51">[+51]</a> and proclaimed a
programme that suited the Orthodox - a campaign against Catholic Europe  <a name="sik5text52"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note52">[+52]</a></p>
<p>Guyuk had no luck Prince Yaroslav Vsevolodovich, summoned <b><font COLOR="#943634">{310}
</font></b>for negotiations, was poisoned by the particularly stupid and
imperious queen Toregena. Toregena simply could not grasp the consequences of
what she was doing. She believed the denunciation by boyar Fedor Yarunovich who
was in the suite of the Vladimir prince and was intriguing against him for his
own personal concerns. The sympathy of the murdered prince's children was
diverted to Batu and he gained a secure rear and military aid thanks to which he
was able to undertake a campaign against the great khan Guyuk's games with the
Nestorians also turned out unsuccessful. Early in 1248 Guyuk suddenly died, not
from his excesses and not from poison Batu, gaining a preponderance in forces,
put Mongke, Tolui's son and leader of the Nestorian party, on the throne Guyuk's
adherents were executed in 1251.</p>
<p>The external policy of the Mongol ulus immediately changed.
The offensive against Catholic Europe was cancelled and, instead, the Yellow
Crusade  <a name="sik5text53"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note53">[+53]</a> was started and led to the fall of Baghdad (1258) Batu, virtual head
of the empire, strengthened his position, attached new subjects to himself and
created the conditions for converting the Golden Horde into an independent
khanate, this took place after Mongke's death when a new wave of disturbances
broke in part of Chinggiskhan's empire Nestorianism, linked with the princes of
Tolui's line, was found beyond the limits of the Golden Horde.</p>
<p>After Batu's conquest of Rus` and his quarrel with the heir
to the throne, subsequently the great khan Guyuk (1241), Batu's son Sartak dealt
with Russian affairs in the Golden Horde Sartak's Christian sympathies were
widely known and there is even evidence that he was baptised - according to the
Nestorian ritual, of course  <a name="sik5text54"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note54">[+54]</a> Yet Sartak did not favour the Catholics and
Orthodox, making an exception only for his personal friend, Aleksandr
Yaroslavich Nevskii In such circumstances, direct attacks by a Russian writer on
Nestorianism were dangerous, but at the same time the subject was so generally
known that the reader would need only a hint to understand the point. For
example, it was enough to make the hero of the tale, prince Igor`, undertake a
pilgrimage to the icon of the Pirogoshcha Virgin for the reader to understand
that the hero is by <b><font COLOR="#943634">{311} </font></b>no means a friend
of those baptised Tatars who called Mary &quot;Mother of Christ&quot; [see
above, pp. 37-8 and below, p. 322], and thus his relation to the Tatars
themselves was determined. Although there was no censorship in the thirteenth
century, agitation against the government even then was not without danger, and
a hint allowed the author to express his idea and remain alive.</p>
<p>This situation continued until the death of Sartak in 1256,
after which Berke-khan adopted Islam, but allowed a diocese to be established in
Sarai in 1261 and favoured the Orthodox, relying on them in war with the Persian
Ilkhans who protected Nestorianism. For the Russian reader the Nestorian
question ceased to be pressing.</p>
<p>These are the basic reasons why we should consider the
thirteenth century a period when concern with Nestorianism was at its sharpest
and, consequently, echoes should be heard in the literature of neighbouring
peoples. They are met with in Catholic, Muslim and Armenian authors where these
references could not evoke complications with authority. In Rus` they were
veiled and one can find them only by complex deduction.</p>
<p>So, for the Russian political thinker the Nestorian problem
became pressing only after Rus` had been included in the Mongol ulus; then it
became not without danger to abuse the religion, even though it was not a
dominant, but an influential one. Then there arose the necessity for allegory
and the Kalka could be converted into the Kayala, and the Tatars into Polovtsy.
 <a name="sik5text55"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note55">[+55]</a> It was better to keep quiet about emissaries, though, both because the
Mongols considered them guests and so particularly inviolable and never forgave
the treacherous murder of an emissary, and also because it was risky to remind
the khan's advisers of the religious hatred towards them. We have information on
this enmity from foreign sources. Hungarian missionaries point out, from the
words of Russian refugees who emigrated to Saxony from Kiev after Batu had
sacked <b><font COLOR="#943634">{312} </font></b>it, that the Tatar force had
many &quot;most dishonourable Christians&quot;,  <a name="sik5text56"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note56">[+56]</a> i.e. Nestorians. In the Lay
this question is veiled, although there are hints that the author knew of the
Nestorian creed. But, then, the Lay is a literary, not a historical work.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Kernel and Shell</h4>
<p>&nbsp;If this is so, we should seek not a direct description of
events in the Lay, but a graphic one which leads the reader to the author's
conclusions by means of hint, allegory and comparison. This principle,
widespread in recent literature, was also used in the Middle Ages, for instance,
in the Song of Roland, Moors were put instead of Basques. Such substitution did
not shock the reader who would perceive the clash embodied in the subject and
would take the hint, making the necessary correction. It is curious that
present-day sectarians read and perceive the Old Testament in just this way. The
Assyrians, Philistines or Chaldeans do not interest them at all, but they
interpret the conflicts in the subject-matter in terms of the conditions in
which they are living and draw heterogeneous conclusions (as a rule, false) from
what they have read. Doubtless the readers of the Lay were more educated and
knew how to separate the literal from the allegorical, but it is clear that both
were combined in the text of the work.</p>
<p>So, in the Lay, we should separate the kernel of the topic
which reflects the real situation of concern to the author and reader from the
shell of images which, as in any historical novel or poem, is nothing but a
veil. Yet even images have their own regularities suggested by the genre, and
they, along with the conflicts in the subject-matter, allow us to find that
unique date when the composition of such a work was imperative.</p>
<p>The summons of which we spoke above was mainly addressed to
three princes: those of Galich, Vladimir and Kiev; in the second place, the
south-western princes were called on, but there was no call at all to the
princes of Seversk and the Novgorodians, and a special attitude was shown to
Polotsk which will be dealt with below. Let us see when the political situation
answered to these conditions. Only in 1249-52, neither earlier, nor later.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{313} </font></b>In these years Daniil
of Galich and Andrei Yaroslavich of Vladimir were preparing to rise against Batu
and trying to draw Aleksandr Yaroslavich, prince of Kiev and Novgorod, into the
alliance. Let us also remember that K. Marx supposed that the Lay was written
immediately before the Tatar incursion.  <a name="sik5text57"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note57">[+57]</a> Yes, but inasmuch as the author of
the Lay could not foretell Batu's incursion it is more natural to suppose he had
Nevryui's incursion of 1252 in mind,  <a name="sik5text58"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note58">[+58]</a> and it had not been difficult to
foresee this a year or two in advance. And it is scarcely possible for such a
patriot as the author of the Lay, if our hypothesis is right and he really was a
contemporary of these events, to ignore the only major attempt by the Russian
princes to cast off the authority of the Tatar khan. To confirm our supposition
let us turn to the details of the events and the characters of the princes. If
we are on the right track, the details and descriptions of the Lay should depict
the thirteenth, not the twelfth century situation and thirteenth-century figures
should be hidden beneath the masks of twelfth-century princes. Let us look at
the treatment of the princes in this respect.</p>
<p>First of all, Svyatoslav of Kiev, who was not at all
menacing, still less powerful. He only came to the throne with the help of the
Polovtsy and Lithuanians, and he held only the town of Kiev, while the lands of
the principality were held by Ryurik Rostislavich. But then Aleksandr Nevskii
was both menacing and mighty.</p>
<p>The choice of the peoples who &quot;sing Svyatoslav's
glory&quot; after the victory over Kobyak (p. 18), the representative of the
steppe, is very interesting, and by no means fortuitous: Germans, Venetians,
Greeks and Czechs-Moravians. Here the limits of Batu's campaign to the west are
precisely sketched. The Germans, defeated at Liegnitz, but holding the line of
resistance at Olomouc, the Venetians, whose possessions forward detachments of
Tatars reached in 1241, the Greeks of the Nicaean empire, who under John
Vatatzes had taken the Balkan peninsula and, as Bulgaria suffered from Batu's
army on its return, also bordered territory devastated by the Tatars, and the
Czechs-Moravians who had conquered a Tatar detachment at Olomouc. All these four
peoples were potential allies for a struggle against the Tatars in the 1240s.
The <b><font COLOR="#943634">{314} </font></b>researcher should not be confused
by the inclusion of the Nicaean empire along with three Catholic states, because
Frederick II Hohenstaufen and John Vatatzes became allies with a common enemy,
the Pope, and the Emperor sanctioned the future seizure of Constantinople by the
Greeks, again to spite the Pope as protector of the Latin Empire.</p>
<p>These four peoples condemn Igor for his defeat. &quot;What
business is this of ours ?&quot; would seem to have been their attitude, if the
author really had in view a mere frontier clash. But their condemnation is
understandable, if he had in view a clash of two worlds.</p>
<p>Further, the author of the Lay considers that in Rus` itself
there are enough forces to throw off the Tatar yoke. Let us recall that Andrei
Yaroslavich of Vladimir and Daniil Romanovich of Galich held the same opinion.
The author lists the princes and their forces and again depicts the thirteenth,
not the twelfth century. First, the prince of Vladimir, allegedly Vsevolod, but
actually Andrei: he has such a large force that he can &quot;scatter the Volga
in drops from his oars and ladle out the Don from his helmets&quot; (p. 21). To
summon Vsevolod Big Nest, enemy of Svyatoslav and Igor, to the south is more
than strange. But in 1250 to summon the prince of Vladimir to struggle with the
steppe was totally relevant, for Andrei actually took the field against the
Tatars and was routed by Nevryui, after the Lay had been written, it seems. We
must presume that there was hope of success by Andrei and his comrades.</p>
<p>Then there is a brief panegyric to the sons of Rostislav from
Smolensk, allies of Vsevolod Big Nest in 1182, with an appeal to stand forth
&quot;for the offence of this time, for the Russian land&quot; (p. 22). Smolensk
had not been destroyed by the Tatars during their incursion and had preserved
its military potential, and to turn to the people of Smolensk for help in
1249-50 was completely sensible, while in the twelfth century they had been the
bitterest enemies of the descendants of Oleg in Chernigov.</p>
<p>The appeal to the south-western princes is equally apposite;
it says they have &quot;iron followers in Latin helmets&quot; (p. 23) and
&quot;Polish spears&quot; (p. 24). But the descendants of Oleg of Chernigov are
not included in the list (p. 23), because in 1246 they had been executed by Batu
as a result of intrigues by the Vladimir princes  <a name="sik5text59"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note59">[+59]</a> and the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{315}
</font></b>Chernigov principality had been politically smashed. Most important
in the list is Yaroslav Osmomysl [lit. Eight thoughts - trans.] who sits high
&quot;on the gold-wrought throne, has propped up the Hungarian mountains ...
closed the gates of the Danube ... you open the gates of Kiev, you shoot at
sultans beyond the lands from your father's golden throne&quot; (p. 22). The
author of the Lay also proposes he shoots &quot;Konchak the pagan slave&quot;
(p. 22).</p>
<p>If we understand this summons literally, it is nonsense.
Yaroslav Osmomysl was surrounded by people who were stronger than he was -
boyars who deprived him both of his power and his life. In 1187 the boyars burnt
his mistress, Nastas'ya, and compelled Yaroslav to deprive his favourite son (by
Nastas'ya) of his inheritance; after his death, which then took place, they set
his eldest son, a drunkard, on the throne of Galich. The principality of Galich
had no involvement with the lower reaches of the Danube where a strong
Wallachian-Bulgarian kingdom arose in 1185. Yaroslav shot no &quot;sultans&quot;
and the guess about his taking part in the Third Crusade (p. 444) is so
fantastic that it does not deserve further consideration. It is absurd to summon
to decisive actions a prince deprived of power and influence and dying of
nervous traumas, but if under the name of Yaroslav Osmomysl we read &quot;Daniil
of Galich&quot;, everything fits. The Hungarians were routed near Yaroslav in
1249. After the death of John Asen (1241) Bulgaria weakened and the influence of
the principality of Galich extended southwards, perhaps reaching the mouths of
the Danube where, in Dobruja, the remnants of the Pechenegs lived, the Gagauz,
who perhaps still preserved some Muslim traditions.  <a name="sik5text60"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note60">[+60]</a> Kiev, which had been
destroyed, was also <b><font COLOR="#943634">{316} </font></b>under Daniil's
control and, finally, his alliance with Andrei of Vladimir was concluded in 1250
and directed against the Tatars. Apart from the names which were undoubtedly
encoded, everything comes together.</p>
<p>Konchak is also improbable in this context. Why is he a
&quot;pagan slave&quot;? Whose slave, when he is a khan? Why is he called a
pagan when he is the father-in-law of a faithful Russian prince and his son and
heir is baptised and named Yurii (George)? Moreover, Konchak in the recent past
had put Svyatoslav on the golden throne of Kiev and in 1182 was the ally of
Igor` and Svyatoslav against Vsevolod Big Nest and the Smolensk princes. Let us
suppose that he is abused in this way because he played a part in Russian
internecine strife although not a Christian; but heathen Lithuanians took part
on the same side and the author of the Lay does not condemn them for this,
despite his esteem for the grand prince Vsevolod.</p>
<p>But if, in place of Konchak, we place some Tatar baskak, for
example, Kuremsa or Darmala whom we uncovered above, everything will fit. He is
the khan's slave, he is an adherent of an odious religion and in 1249-50 he
would undoubtedly be shot, if we take the position of the author of the Lay. As
for the Lithuanians, one could temporise with them, as with the Germans,
Hungarians and Poles. How correct such a position was is another question;
indeed the author of the Lay does not avoid this point, though his opinion is
expressed with extreme caution as regards a subject having no connection it
would seem with Igor's campaign or, in general, with the Polovtsy steppe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Tragedy of Polotsk</h4>
<p>Polotsk was the shield of the Rus` against blows from the
west. The author of the Lay, although he has much to say about the Polotsk
princes, does not make an appeal to them. He grieves for them. The hero of the
Polotsk section of the Lay, Izyaslav Vasil'kovich, is a puzzle. He is not
mentioned in the chronicle; this would be possible if he had in no way
distinguished himself. But, according to the text of the Lay, he was no less
distinguished than Igor` <b><font COLOR="#943634">{317} </font></b>Svyatoslavich:
he fell in battle with the Lithuanians and the prince's defeat involved the
surrender of the town (p. 95). Which town? One would suppose Polotsk where, in
1239, a certain Bryachislav had his seat; after this, information on the Polotsk
principality ceases.  <a name="sik5text61"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note61">[+61]</a> This name, Bryachislav, is also mentioned in the Lay.
 <a name="sik5text62"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note62">[+62]</a> The brother of a fallen prince who had not come to his aid in time is so
called. Somewhat later is the last mention of the Polotsk land: &quot;on the
Nemiga [Neman] the sheaves are spread like heads, they thresh with steel chains,
lives are laid on the threshing floor, they winnow the soul from the body.
Nemiga's bloody banks are not sown with blessings, they are sown with the bones
of Russian sons&quot; (p. 25). This insertion as regards the composition relates
to the defeat of Vseslav by princes Izyaslav, Svyatoslav and Vsevolod
Yaroslavich (p. 458) in 1067. Yet this excerpt is not placed in the Lay before
Vseslav ascends the throne of Kiev and he flees, but after, i.e. after 1069.
Such a leap is not justified if the slaughter on the Nemiga is related to
Vseslav's times, but if we count the recollection of it as an association by an
author thinking of his own time, the insertion should refer to the time when the
Lay was written, i.e. we would suppose to the 1240s-50s.</p>
<p>And in the thirteenth century there was precisely such a
situation. The Lithuanians seized the principality of Polotsk and extended their
destructive raids as far as Torzhok and Bezhetsk. In 1245 Aleksandr Nevskii
inflicted a defeat on them, but in the following year, when Yaroslav
Vsevolodovich and his sons went to Mongolia, Mikhail Khorobrit of Moscow seized
power in Vladimir and thereupon perished in a battle with the Lithuanians. His
brothers, who condemned his usurpation, did not come to Mikhail's aid, any more
than to that of the mythical, non-existent Izyaslav Vasil'kovich. The author of
the Lay concludes the tragedy of Polotsk with a very emotional exclamation:
&quot;Oh, the Russian land must groan remembering the first year and the first
princes... The spears sing&quot; (p. 26).</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{318} </font></b>How unlike 1187 this
is, when neither Lithuania nor the Polovtsy were any real threat to Rus` Then
there was no need to await salvation from the west, but to temper the appetites
of the seditious boyars of Galich and Rostov, of the &quot;junior people&quot;
of Vladimir and Novgorod and of certain particularly rapacious princes But there
is no mention of this in the Lay The author of the Lay understands splendidly
that the heathen Lithuanians of his day are active enemies of the Russian
princes and of the Catholic Germans  <a name="sik5text63"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note63">[+63]</a> He also mentions the Lithuanians, but in
passing, so as not to distract the reader's attention from the main enemy, the
steppe nomads, i.e. in our opinion, the Tatars He particularly grieves that not
all the princes share his point of view, and in this he was right</p>
<p>Finally, let us turn our attention to a puzzling fragment of
the Lay &quot;the pagans themselves racing onto the Russian land with their
victories took a tribute of a pelt from each household&quot; (p 18) D.S.
Likhachev correctly notes that the Polovtsy took no tribute from the Russians,
but attempts to explain the contradiction as a literary borrowing from the Tale
of Bygone Years under 859 and regards &quot;tribute&quot; in this context as a
symbol of subjection (p 421) Yet there was no subjection to the Polovtsy in the
twelfth century, and could not be But taxation of Southern Rus` by the Tatars
after 1241 did take place According to a law of 1236 introduced by the
chancellor of the Mongol Empire, Ye-lu Chu-cai, taxes from the Chinese were
exacted from the hearth or house, while the Mongols and Muslims paid a poll-tax
Ye-lu Chu-cai introduced this alleviation for the Chinese so as to restore the
economy of the territory which had suffered from the war,  <a name="sik5text64"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note64">[+64]</a> and, as we see,
the privilege was extended to the Russian lands which were in an analogous
situation</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Prince Igor's Pilgrimage</h4>
<p>Igor` Svyatoslavich's boldness and thoughtlessness cost the
land of Seversk dear The Polovtsy replied to the raid by another and &quot;took
the towns along the Sem` and there was grief and heavy oppression such as there
had never been throughout the Sem` area and Novgorod-Seversk, and through the
whole Chernigov volost`, the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{319} </font></b>princes
were seized, the retinue was seized, slaughtered; the towns rose up and everyone
hated his neighbour, and many then renounced their souls, complaining of their
princes&quot; writes the author of the Hypatian Chronicle.  <a name="sik5text65"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note65">[+65]</a> But the author of
the Lay perceives the events thus: &quot;The sun shines in the sky, Igor` is
prince in the Russian land; maidens sing on the Danube, their voices weave
across the sea to Kiev. Igor` goes along Borichev to the Holy Virgin of
Pirogoshcha. The lands are glad, the towns rejoice&quot; (pp. 30-1). The
difference is self-evident.</p>
<p>Who are we to believe? The chronicle, of course. The more so
as, according to Orthodox custom, Igor could address his prayer of thanksgiving
either directly to God, or to the saint in whose honour he was named, or to
Saint George, the liberator of prisoners. Consequently, addressing the Virgin
had some particular meaning, understood by contemporaries of the Lay, but not
noticed by later commentators. The thought strikes us that here is an attack on
the enemies of the Virgin, because the appeal to her covers all prince Igor's
previous sins. These enemies could not be either the Christianised heathen
Polovtsy, or the Muslims, who put Jesus and Mary on one plane, but only the
Nestorians, who called Mary &quot;Mother of Christ&quot;, i.e. an ordinary woman
who gave birth to a man, not God. Worship of Mary was a direct challenge to
Nestorianism.</p>
<p>Even in the twelfth century Igor's campaign, despite its
insignificance, was a turning point in the history of the struggle between the
descendants of Oleg and of Monomakh. Igor` Svyatoslavich violated the tradition
established by his grandfather Oleg: he replaced friendship with the steppe by a
compromise with the descendants of Monomakh which lasted till 1204.  <a name="sik5text66"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note66">[+66]</a> But to
implicate the Virgin in the internecine strife of the Russian princes is beside
the point. On the other hand, when Andrei of Vladimir and Daniil or Galich
prepared their rising against the Tatars, their opponent was not Batu himself,
but his son Sartak, a secret Nestorian and an open protector of Nestorians, who
mocked the Orthodox Russians and Alans. It was in the war with Sartak that the
Virgin not only could, but should have appeared on the banner of the rebels; an <b><font COLOR="#943634">{320}
</font></b>appeal to her would be counted as participating in the revolt. When
Sartak was poisoned in 1256 for his Nestorian sympathies, his uncle Berke,
despite his having gone over to Islam, began to protect the Orthodox and in 1262
made a clean break from the Mongol-Persian and the Mongol-Chinese uluses where
the Nestorians still predominated.</p>
<p>Thus, the upper limit for the writing of the Lay is 1256,
i.e. the death of Sartak and, consequently, the only probable situation
stimulating a work of an anti-nomad and anti-Nestorian trend remains that of
1249-52, the three years when Rus` was preparing for the rising put down by
Sartak and his military leader Nevryui.</p>

<h4>Poet and Prince</h4>
<p>Now has come the time to pose the question of the genre of
this work. This is essential in order to know in what sense we can use it as a
source of information about the period we are interested in. The problem of
genre, though, falls entirely within the field of literary studies and the
decisive word belongs to the representative of this branch of knowledge.</p>
<p>In an article appended to his edition of the Lay of Igor's
Host, D.S. Likhachev writes: &quot;The Lay is the impassioned speech of a
patriot and lover of his people [p. 249] ... However, it would be mistaken to
think we have before us a typical work of oratory (p. 251) ... If it is a
speech, it is close to song; if it is a song, it is close to speech.
Unfortunately, we cannot determine the genre of the Lay more precisely&quot; [p.
252].</p>
<p>This is really a pity, because despite the fact that the
quotations cited are exceedingly fine, they fail to resolve the perplexity with
which we started. After all, speech, and song, and poem are always either an
invention, or a simple transmission of information; either glorification and
abuse, or persuasion and so on. If our analysis of the source against the
background of the historical circumstances of the mid-thirteenth century is
right, then the Lay of Igor's Host is not a heroic epic, but a political
lampoon. This thought does not contradict D.S. Likhachev's definitions, but it
concerns aspects of the question he did not focus on.</p>
<p>But could this form of literature exist in the thirteenth
century? Why ever not. It flourished in ancient Greece and Rome; there are so
many examples, it is not worth listing them. It was used in <b><font COLOR="#943634">{321}
</font></b>medieval Persia where Nizam al-Mulk gave a tendentious account of the
Mazdak movement, clearly with didactic aims. Finally, the Secret History of the
Mongols is a work of the same genre which has survived from among many stolen
from us by cruel Chronos. Why should the Russians be considered less gifted than
the eastern peoples contemporary with them? When there is a demand for a genre
and talented authors exist, the genre appears and finds a reader. After the
destruction of 1237-41 there was such a demand and the Russian land did not lack
talent.</p>
<p>The terrible and unexpected defeat made all thinking Russians
consider the fate of their country. And the question was who was worse, the
Tatars or the Germans.  <a name="sik5text67"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note67">[+67]</a></p>
<p>As we have seen, the author of the Lay had a pro-western
attitude. Consequently, the literary arrow he released was directed at the
breast of the faithful prince Aleksandr Yaroslavich Nevskii, friend of Batu,
sworn brother of Sartak and enemy of the knights of the Teutonic Order. But
there is no image of this prince in our text. There is something else:
individual aspects describing Aleksandr Nevskii's activity, but not his
personality. Why this should be so is absolutely understandable. The Lay was
written counting on a widespread response and, so, should reach Aleksandr
Nevskii; and he was severe. Then, the charm of Aleksandr's personality, which
surprised even Batu himself, could least of all be the subject of an attack. The
author of the Lay does not condemn the prince's persona, but his pro-Tatar
policy. The condemnation, though, creeps in everywhere. Reliance on the steppe
dwellers is condemned in evaluating Oleg Gorislavich, rapidity of movement and
quarrels with the Novgorodians in describing Vseslav whom &quot;God's judgement
shall not pass by&quot; (p. 26) and, most important, the indicator of a hostile
attitude are the hints of friendship with the infidels, the enemies of the
Virgin, protectress of Kiev. But what was common to the Nestorians and Aleksandr
Nevskii, and was also something that was obvious to the thirteenth-century
members of the retinue without explanation?</p>
<p>Aleksandr Yaroslavich, preparing to fight Andrei Yaroslavich
who relied on Catholic Europe, went for aid to the Horde, but not <b><font COLOR="#943634">{322}
</font></b>to Batu himself, but to his son Sartak,  <a name="sik5text68"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note68">[+68]</a> defender of the
Nestorians. The victory in 1252 was achieved with the help of Sartak's troops.
Aleksandr's friendship with Sartak was well known, and therefore the opposite
party hinted, not without foundation, at the prince's tendency to Nestorianism,
but on the political, not the religious plane.</p>
<p>If our hypothesis is right, Oleg's heir, prince Igor, as a
literary hero, not a historical person, should have entered the fight against
the Orthodox, not only against the pagan Polovtsy. In fact, Div warns all those
countries threatened by Igor's forces (p. 79): the &quot;Unknown Land&quot;, the
Polovtsy steppe; the Volga, the region of the Christian Khazars; the maritime
area, i.e. the shores of the Black Sea where the Orthodox Goths lived in the
twelfth century; the Sula region where Pereyaslavl`, the citadel of Russian
pro-Greek attitudes, stood; Surozh, Cherson and Tmutarakan`, the Greek trading
towns. Neither the Khazars by the Caspian, nor the Black Sea Greeks and Goths
did Rus` any harm, so the version that Igor's campaign was directed against them
has a quite different meaning from that usually understood. For the twelfth
century it was senseless, but impossible for the thirteenth since the forces of
Sartak lay between Rus` and the Black Sea. It is evident that here is no
historical description of events, but an allegory.</p>
<p>In fact, the mid-thirteenth-century situation is given
clearly even in this extract. The remnants of the defeated, but not subjugated,
Polovtsy who had fled to Hungary from the Mongols would have formed the best
cavalry units of the force which could have moved against the Golden Horde. They
would have been the most reliable allies of the Russians, had the Russians risen
against the Mongols. Therefore, Div warns, not the peoples, but the lands
occupied at the time the work was written by peoples loyal to the Horde, though
Orthodox, evidently wanderers and Byzantines. The religious factor is obvious,
but the Polovtsy here are no more than a literary metaphor.</p>
<p>In this way the ending of the Lay finds an explanation.
Igor's pilgrimage to Kiev &quot;to the Pirogoshcha Virgin&quot; (p. 31) is
presented as the greatest achievement. This is purely didactic: here, it says,
is a descendant of Oleg, grandson of the enemy of the Kiev Metropolitan diocese,
friend of Boyan who &quot;raced in the path of Troy an&quot; <b><font COLOR="#943634">{323}
</font></b>(p. 11), and he has reconciled himself with the Holy Virgin Mary and
the whole Russian land has then rejoiced. And you, prince Aleksandr, should do
the same, and there would be an end to the pagans! The sense of the whole work
of genius lies in this, and it was worth writing it before Aleksandr decided to
break with Andrei and to turn for help to the Tatars, i.e. before 1252.</p>
<p>Was the author of the Lay and his friends, Andrei of Vladimir
and Daniil of Galich, right? In some ways, yes and in some ways, no! To break
away from the Horde by the joint efforts of all the princes would have been
possible, it seems, but this would have meant then falling under the yoke of
feudal Catholic Europe. Then the whole of the Russian land would have shared the
fate of Belorussia and Galicia: Aleksandr Nevskii saw further than his brothers
and the ideologist of their political line, the author of the Lay of Igor's
Host. He was not seduced by the fine words: &quot;better to be killed than to be
captured&quot; (p. 10) or by the angry denunciation: &quot;And the princes
themselves brought dissension on themselves, and the pagans themselves with the
victories raced into the Russian land exacting tribute of a pelt from each
household&quot; (pp. 18, 421). The Tatars took a tribute from each household
only in the 1250s,  <a name="sik5text69"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note69">[+69]</a> but in 1262 the tribute collectors sent by khan Kubilai's
central government were, on the initiative of the same Aleksandr Nevskii,
slaughtered by the Russian population.  <a name="sik5text70"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note70">[+70]</a></p>
<p>What is most interesting here is that the khan of the Golden
Horde, Berke, not only failed to take punitive measures, but used the
disturbance to his own advantage; he separated from the central Horde and
converted his region into an independent state in which the Russian element
played not the smallest part. After 1262 the links between the Golden Horde and
the eastern line of Tolui's descendants were broken; the latter were based in
Beijing and in 1271 took the Chinese name of Yuan. In essence, this was the
freeing of Eastern Europe from the Mongol yoke, although it took place under the
banner of the khans, descendants of the senior Chinggisid, Jochi, who had been
killed on his father's order because he had been the first to put forward a
programme of reconciliation with the conquered.  <a name="sik5text71"></a><a href="sik5a.htm#sik5note71">[+71]</a> It is not by chance that
thereupon a war <b><font COLOR="#943634">{324} </font></b>started between the
Golden Horde and the Persian Mongols, active Nestorians, who continued
Chinggis's policy of conquest. In 1262-3 khan Berke's government was still
uncertain whether to continue the line of Mongol tradition or, yielding to force
of circumstances, to head the peoples who agreed to link their fate with the
Horde. Aleksandr's last journey to Sarai, when he deflected calamity from his
people, was, we may think, the deed which determined the choice of khan. This
was the first liberation of Russia from the Mongols - Aleksandr Nevskii's
greatest service.</p>
<p>Thus, the sensible prince was more perspicacious than the
talented poet. But we must not deny the author of the Lay either sincerity, or
patriotism, or the call to unity, with the sole proviso that the opposite side
was also calling for unity.</p>
<p>The reader may raise the question: why, after nearly two
centuries of intensive study of the text, has no one hit on the thought
propounded here and which, even now, seems to many scholars a paradoxical
conjecture? Is the author of this book more learned and able than the brilliant
constellation of Slavists?</p>
<p>Of course not. The point lies not in one's personal
abilities, but in the approach. Literary scholars have, undoubtedly brilliantly,
made all possible use of the inductive method, but it is limited. Of course, if
there were no ready selection of material, which we call &quot;direct
information&quot;, the application of the deductive method would be unrealisable,
but this is precisely the aim of the present work, to find a method to
accommodate induction and deduction, equally essential in the historian's lofty
calling.</p>

Turkic and Mongol words are distorted out of all recognition and this confuses
the researchers <i>Khin </i>and <i>Jin </i>sound different, but <i>Kin, </i>the
reading accepted in classical Orientalists` literature and which corresponds to
the twelfth- to thirteenth-century phoneme, would inevitably evoke the correct

add to them for the sake of a spurious precision.</p>
<p>Equally, <i>khin </i>can not be Chin, the name of China long
accepted in the Near East and Europe. The Chinese themselves called their
country either Zhong-guo, the Middle Kingdom, or, in relations with foreigners,

with an ultimatum and they returned unharmed. Evidently there was an essential
difference between the first and the second missions, and G.V. Vernadsky
perceived it by means of a detailed analysis of the text of the chronicle. If
the first emissaries had been killed merely as Tatars, the same fate would have
overtaken the second mission, the more so since the emissaries appealed for
justice to the &quot;heavenly God&quot;. But then not every monotheism is
Christianity, and men in the Middle Ages were more tolerant of pagans than of

left bank of the Lower Tunguska, near its junction with the Letnyaya, I found a
post of barked fir about 3 metres long. A bird about 20 cm long, carved with a
knife, was fixed to it. The Ket explained that this was the shaman symbol of the
soul set there to protect the place from evil spirits. According to them, the
whole force of the protection resided in the bird.</p>
<p><a name="sik5note44"></A><A HREF="sik5a.htm#sik5text44">[+44]</a> Precisely from them, since west Siberian paganism differs
in principle from shamanism The Ugnan wizard &quot;tames the spirits as
reindeer&quot;, but does not make friends with them The Ket consider that their
faith and that of the Evenk &quot;is different&quot; (personal questioning by
the author on the Lower Tunguska in 1943).</p>

studying the political situation in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries.</p>

and the Kalka in 1223 made by the author of the &quot;Zadonshchina&quot;, who
regarded the battle of Kulikovo Field as revenge for the Kalka, has been noted
by D S Likhachev (<i>Natsional`noe samosoznanie drevnei Rusi, </i>M.-L., 1945),
who pointed out that the &quot;Zadonshchina&quot; should be regarded as a retort
to the Lay of Igor's Host (see also V.P. Adrianova-Peretts, &quot;'Slovo o polku
Igoreve' i 'Zadonshchina'&quot;, in &quot;<i>Slovo o polku Igoreve - pamyatnik

the Lay is of greater antiquity than the &quot;Zadonshchina&quot;, since after
1262 the Nestorian problem ceased to be topical.</p>

<p><a name="sik5note60"></A><A HREF="sik5a.htm#sik5text60">[+60]</a> Bakri informs us of the spread of Islam among the
eleventh-century Pechenegs &quot;┘ after the year 400 A.H. there happened
among them a Muslim prisoner, a learned theologian who explained Islam to some
of them and, in consequence, they accepted it. Their intentions were sincere and
the propagation of Islam began to spread among them. The others, though, who had
not accepted Islam, reproved them for doing this and the matter ended in warfare
God granted victory to the Muslims although they were only 12,000 and the
infidel twice as many. They [the Muslims] killed them, and those who remained
alive accepted Islam They are now all Muslims and they have learned men, those
who know the law and readers of the Koran&quot; (A. Kunik, V. Rozen, <i>Izvestiya
al-Bakri i drugikh avtorov o Rusi i slavyanakh, </i>58-60). Evidently, we have
here a tendentious exaggeration, since the facts of the conversion of individual
Pecheneg khans <i>{PSRL, </i>ix, 57, 64) and the general populace under the
treaty with Constantine Monomachus in 1051 are known, this would have been
impossible, had they already belonged to another world religion Yet there is a
kernel of truth in Bakri's statement (see S.P. Tolstov, <i>Po sledam
drevnekhorezmiiskoi tsivilizatsii,</i>262), and the existence of Muslim nomads
in the Black Sea steppes accounts for the ease with which Ozbeg, khan of the
Golden Horde (1312), was converted to Islam, evidently catering for a decent
number of Muslim nomads.</p>

proposed (in a private communication) that we should read &quot;Vseslav&quot; in
place of &quot;Vsevolod&quot;, then the retrospective composition makes sense
there was no second Vseslav who would have been able to defend Polotsk against
its enemies, and then follows the emotional digression about Vseslav, prince of
Polotsk, in which events are enumerated in reverse chronological order (pp.
24-6).</p>
