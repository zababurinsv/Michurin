<h3><a name="sik1para02">2. An Excursion into
Geography</a></h3>
<h4>Land and People</h4>
<p>Bounded on the north and north-east by the Siberian taiga, on
the south by the Great Wall of China and the mountain ranges of Alashan, Beishan,
Kunlun and Pamirs, the broad steppe has had a constant population from of old.
Yet the states on this territory started to arise relatively late, not earlier
than the fourth-third centuries <i>B.C. </i>The impenetrable stony waste of the
Gobi separated the northern from the southern part of the steppe; relations
between them were inconceivable until the complete acquisition of the horse had
turned sedentary hunters and herdsmen into nomadic herdsmen and warriors.</p>
<p>Before nomadic herding, cultures arose around the steppe
where a combination of differing landscapes offered an opening to man's economic
activity. Forest-steppe predominates throughout the Sayan-Altai plateau;
sometimes the forest cuts deeply into the steppe, as, for example, does the
famous Utken forest on the slopes of the Hangai; sometimes the steppe penetrates
northward, as do the Khakass steppes in the upper reaches of the Enisei or the
broad Trans-Baikal steppe. An abundance of animals along the forest margins, of
fish in the broad rivers, and of copper and iron deposits in the mountains
enabled the ancient inhabitants of Southern Siberia to obtain the surplus
essential for the growth of culture. The development of herding, mainly horses,
drew man onto the steppe; here extensive practice in the battue compensated him
for the loss of some of the skills of trapping and for the struggle against
mosquitoes. The northern herdsman was drawn south.</p>
<p>The situation was somewhat different in the south-east. The
Chinese grew particularly strong from among a large number of varied tribal
groups occupying the Huang He basin (Zhun, Di and Hu). They gradually
subordinated, and partly exterminated, the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{19}
</font></b>tribes surrounding them, except for those which
succeeded in taking to nomadic herding and thus retreating to the steppe. Such
were the ancestors of the Mongols, the Dunhu, the Turkic Hun and the &quot;Western
Qiang&quot;, ancestors of the Tibetans.  <a name="sik1text10"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note10">[+10]</a></p>
<p>In bitter struggle with emergent China, the Mongols, Turks
and Tibetans were able to defend their freedom and create a culture adapted to
their way of life, while the &quot;southern barbarians&quot; - the forest and
mountain tribes of Sichuan and Yunnan and Eastern China were almost completely
exterminated or Sinicized. The same fate threatened the Turks and Mongols, but,
having acquired the technique of mounted warfare and of long nomad treks, they
found a means of avoiding the destructive Chinese incursions, hiding behind the
Gobi and resting in the grassy steppes of Khalkha or Barga before throwing
themselves with new forces into mortal battle with the Chinese for possession of
their homeland, the Ordos and the foothills of the Alashan or the Xing`an.</p>
<p>Century-long struggles toughened the herdsmen and enabled
them to become a leading force throughout Inner Asia in the period with which we
are concerned. Therefore, the states they founded and their system of life,
uniquely peculiar to them, will be a main subject of our investigation.</p>
<p>On the slopes of the Tianshan in the south-west we see a
different situation from either of the preceding ones. The Taklamakan desert,
occupying an enormous area, is completely unsuitable for life. The central part
of Dzungaria is covered by quicksands. The regression of Lake Balkhash resulted
in the gradual desiccation of the nearby steppes and a reduction in pastures.
Life in this area is concentrated mainly in oases stretching in several chains
from the ancient town of Shash (Tashkent) to the oasis of Hami. The nomads,
however, still disposed of quite a lot of land, since they always had the
mountain and foothill pastures of the Tianshan, the river valley of the Ili, Chu,
Black Irtysh, Tarim and the hilly high ground of Tarbagatai.</p>
<p>Here conditions were much more favourable to the herdsmen
than in the east. The scattered oases did not form a single state and became
easy prey to the nomads. Moreover, the oasis rulers sought their help against
the encroaching Chinese and Arabs. Thus, conditions in the west favoured nomad
attacks, but not <b><font COLOR="#943634">{20} </font></b>nomad
development on the spot. In fact, the tribes diverted here from the east, or
arising locally, as a result of ethnogenesis, strove to develop a broad advance
on the south, India and Persia became in turn the object of their attacks. This
gave rise to the Sakas, Kushans, Turkmen-Seljuks, Karluk and Kipchak. But the
states founded by these conquerors have closer links with the countries of South
Asia which fell under their sway than with the steppe from which they came.</p>
<p>The Turks and Mongols were the masters of the Inner Asia
steppe. Both these groups - at first ethnic, later linguistic - incorporated
many independent peoples so adapted to the steppes that their economic
activities fused with the processes of nature and they became in some sense, as
it were, part of the landscape they had acquired, or the uppermost, final link
in the biocenosis of the steppes. Their herds displaced the wild ungulates,
depriving them of pasture and of water from the few springs Steppe dogs and
trained eagles exterminated the wolves, so that sheep, the main livestock of the
herdsmen of the Eurasian steppe, greatly increased in numbers. Thus, man
replaced the large predators that usually, in natural conditions, controlled the
growth of the herbivorous animals.</p>
<p>The nomad, though, not only failed to lose his tendency to
collective forms of society, to perceive the culture of others and create his
own and of complex forms of organisation - clan, military, democratic and state
- but developed these tendencies so far that, in the course of two thousand
years, he successfully carried on a struggle with his sedentary neighbours. The
balance of forces changed more than once. The nomads sometimes weakened and fell
under the power of their sedentary neighbours, they sometimes gained strength
and, in their turn, conquered the neighbouring states and peoples. There was a
political equilibrium between the nomadic and sedentary peoples.</p>
<p>The cause here, as indeed everywhere, lies in economics. Yet
an extensive nomad economy depends solely on natural conditions which in the
course of two millennia by no means remained unchanged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Air and Water</h4>
<p>The question of the desiccation of the steppes of Central
Asia has evoked sharp polemics G.E. Grumm-Grzhvmailo, N.V. Pavlov, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{21}
</font></b>V. A. Smirnov, V.M. Sinitsyn, and A.V. Shnitnikov have
argued for it, L.S. Berg, K.N. Markov and others against.  <a name="sik1text11"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note11">[+11]</a></p>
<p>The arguments of the protagonists of the theory were not
contraverted by L.S. Berg sufficiently convincingly, but E.M. Murzaev has
adduced some most interesting points which enable us to pose and answer this
question in a different fashion. He noted: &quot;Zhu K`ezhen's recent
investigations, based on meteorological observations from the Chinese chronicles
over the last 2000 years, have shown that we may only speak of pulsations in
China's climate, and by no means of a tendency towards an arid type.  <a name="sik1text12"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note12">[+12]</a> L.A.
Efremov, who has studied the paleontology of the Gobi,
writes: &quot;We need to note the signs of a more complex process of desiccation
in the Gobi region than has been hitherto supposed. The onset of an arid climate
seems to us to have been completed recently. This process should be considered
as taking place in two stages with a comparatively moist interval between them.  <a name="sik1text13"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note13">[+13]</a></p>
<p>We must note that all the researchers cited, in talking about
the desiccation of the steppes, have failed to notice the discrepancy between
the increase in moistness of the arid and the humid zones and so failed to reach
a final conclusion. Introducing the principle of heterochronic increases in
moistness, and an additional corrective for possible displacement of the track
of cyclones into the arctic, has allowed the climatic variations to be followed
with much greater precision, based on the historical and archaeological evidence.</p>
<p>Two columns of air are the chief influence on the climate of
the northern hemisphere, in particular of the Old World. One of them is
stationed over the North Pole; this is the polar baric maximum. The second, the
transtropic maximum, hangs over the Sahara and Arabia. It is formed purely
mechanically as a result of the earth's rotation and its base is continually
dissipated from the heating up of the desert surface. While the polar maximum
remains on the whole immobile, the transtropical maximum continually moves, now
north, now south, and this changes the region of low pressure which acts as a
sort of gully through which moist Atlantic air flows into Eurasia in the form of
cyclones. These cyclones are what causes precipitation in this territory.</p>
<p>The direction of the cyclones depends on how active the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{22}
</font></b>transtropical maximum is; and this is directly
proportional to variations in the activity of the sun, since it is in the
tropical zone that its rays strike with full force. On the other hand,
variations in solar activity have almost no influence on the polar maximum,
since the sun's rays only skate over the surface of the polar regions.</p>
<p>In years of a quiet sun, i.e. when there is little solar
activity, the path of the cyclones passes through the Mediterranean and Black
Seas, the North Caucasus and Kazakhstan right up to the mountain ranges of the
Altai and the Tianshan. Here they are held up and the moisture they bring from
the wastes of the Atlantic falls as rain. There is then an increase in steppe
moisture. Grass covers the desert. The steppe rivers flowing from the slopes of
the Altai, Tarbagatai, Tianshan and the Pamirs are full. Balkhash and the Aral
Sea fill with water and increase in size. On the other hand, the Caspian Sea,
which receives 81% of its water from the Volga with its basin in the central
zone of European Russia, dries up and is reduced in size. Precipitation in the
Volga basin, and throughout the central zone, is greatly reduced. Here rivers
grow shallow and disappear, lakes become marshes and peat bogs, there are severe
winters with little snow cover which alternate with dry, hot summers. Further
north, in the polar region, the White and the Barents Seas are covered by ice,
the permafrost moves south, raising the level of lakes in the tundra.</p>
<p>With increased solar activity the transtropical maximum
begins to move north, moving the track of the Atlantic cyclones in the same
direction. The cyclones travel over the central belt of Europe and Siberia.
Precipitation in the steppe declines considerably. Steppe desiccation begins.
Balkhash and the Aral Sea become shallow and reduced in size. On the other hand,
the Volga becomes broad and full, the Caspian Sea becomes full of water and
grows in size.</p>
<p>In the forest zone, the winter is snowy and mild with
frequent rises in temperature, but summer is cool and rainy.</p>
<p>When there is very high solar activity the cyclones move
still further north. They track over Scotland and Scandinavia to the White and
Kara Seas. The steppe becomes desert and semi-desert, its frontier with the
forest moves north. The Volga grows shallow, the Caspian is reduced in size.</p>
<p>The polar climate becomes more warm and moist.</p>
<p>Such are the three basic variants in the tracking of the
Atlantic cyclones on which, directly and indirectly, the history of the Great <b><font COLOR="#943634">{23}
</font></b>Steppe depends. Changes in the direction of the
cyclones take place continually, and we now have the possibility to date periods
of increased moisture and of desiccation in the Eurasian steppes.</p>
<p>Let us leave aside deep antiquity and see how the climate
changed in the steppe zone throughout our period. The fourth-third centuries
B.C., to which the oldest more or less detailed written information on the
peoples of Central Asia go back, were a period of increasing moisture on the
steppe, linked with the southward variant of the cyclonic tracks. At that time
the level of the Caspian was 8 m below the level it is today, although the Uzboi
then supplied it with surplus water from the Amu Darya since it did not empty
itself into the Aral Sea. Then, gradually the precipitation in the steppes
started to fall: the cyclones started to move into the forest zone. A period of
steppe desiccation occurs in the first-third centuries A.D. Balkhash and the
Aral Sea were sharply reduced and the levels of the Caspian rose 4 m.</p>
<p>In the fourth century the cyclones again shifted south and
the steppe again flourished. This continued up to the thirteenth century with a
brief period of desiccation in the ninth century. From the mid-thirteenth
century the track of the cyclones moved into the central zone. By the start of
the fourteenth century the Caspian Sea had risen to 8 m above its present level.
The Great Steppe entered a period of dry climate.</p>
<p>In the course of the following centuries the cyclones shifted
to the polar zone, then, in the eighteenth-nineteenth centuries returned to the
central zone, and in the twentieth, literally before our eyes, have again moved
north.  <a name="sik1text14"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note14">[+14]</a></p>
<p>It is easy to understand what an enormous part such changes
in steppe climate played in the history of the nomads of Eurasia. Livestock
cannot live without grass, grass grow without water, or nomads exist without
livestock. Consequently, all these form a single system in which the key link is
water. Given a lengthy drought, the Gobi creeps onto the steppes, expands and
becomes a <b><font COLOR="#943634">{24} </font></b>barrier
difficult to overcome between the valley of the Ordos and those of the Orkhon,
Onon and Selenga. With increased moisture, the vegetation proceeds to advance.
It moves against the desert from both south and north, and behind the grass come
the wild ungulates, then sheep, cows and horses bearing their riders. The last
create military hordes and the mighty powers of the nomads.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Road to Truth</h4>
<p>Century-long droughts took place in the third and the tenth
centuries. The last is of particular importance for our theme and we shall deal
with it below. But now we are concerned with the problem of historical method:
has the period between the ninth and thirteenth centuries not remained a &quot;dark
age&quot; because natural phenomena passed unobserved and ignored, the authors
of our medieval sources were unable to observe and describe them, and also
because those sources contained no information on the nomads of the Great Steppe
in this period?</p>
<p>Of course, it could not be otherwise. Periodic variations in
increased moisture and desiccation in the steppe take place in the course of
centuries and cannot be observed in the life of one or three generations. So
ancient authors wrote about natural phenomena either incidentally, or based on
the conceptions of the knowledge of their day. In both cases, the information
they communicate is not to be accepted without historical criticism which can
rarely be adequate since the information is fragmentary and the sources isolated
from one another.</p>
<p>The solution here lies not in the history of peoples, but in
historiography. Only a few of the most outstanding books on history have been
copied in great numbers, yet not all of those have come down to us. The
sixth-eighth centuries was a period when chronicle writing flourished in China.
Brilliant compositions which were frequently copied and carefully preserved were
also devoted to the struggle against the Mongol yoke.</p>
<p>In the intervening period, however, after the bloody spasm of
the &quot;Five Dynasties&quot;, when Chinese art and letters flourished under
the Song dynasty, the energy of gifted writers was entirely devoted to subjects
remote from history and geography. Those active in the trend which N.I. Konrad
has called &quot;the Chinese Renaissance&quot; devoted themselves to the
classical works of Confucius and of his <b><font COLOR="#943634">{25}
</font></b>contemporaries. In a beautiful hand they wrote
numerous commentaries and accounts, including some of the chronicles of past
dynasties, sat their examinations for office seriously, and no less assiduously
took their colleagues to court or condemned them to disgrace. It did not enter
the head of a single one of them that political geography and history with an
ethnographic bias was the basis for understanding the actual situation of a
state surrounded by neighbours with another way of life and culture.</p>
<p>Therefore, however badly the Tang Empire had coped with the
tasks stern reality had set it, it remained firm within the Chinese frontiers
using troops recruited from among friendly nomads. For this the Chinese
intellectuals of the tenth-thirteenth centuries reproached the Tang emperors as
being barbarians, organising a superstitious worship of the Buddha's bones as if
they were participants in his thought, though at the same time they also
rejoiced at their victories over the Turks. Under the Song, the diplomats and
military commanders who had studied the commentaries on Confucius and the
treatises on Mencius found themselves at a loss when they clashed with the
barbarians beyond the Wall: Tibetans, Turks, Mongol-speaking Khitan and Tungus
Jurchen.</p>
<p>They cheerfully made mistake after mistake, got away with it
on account of high-level connections and left the country and people to pay for
everything in tears and blood. They contrived to lose the war although they had
a huge numerical advantage, to advise the government to hand over land and
population to a weak enemy, all in order to save time and energy for the harem;
and if they wrote history, it was only the history of their rule with a view to
gaining a solid reward from it.</p>
<p>I.N. Boltin was triply right when he wrote, in the eighteenth
century: &quot;At every step the historian without geography in his hands
encounters obstacles&quot;. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text15"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note15">[+15]</a></font>
Historical treatises of this period are not of great value. Incidentally, these
faults in method are characteristic of many historical schools which disdain to
look at nature and the characteristic features of peoples inhabiting particular
countries and adapting themselves to the landscape and climate. One always has
to pay dearly for ignorance in the natural sciences.</p>
<p>But a knowledge of geography does not signify the geographic
determinism, formulated by C. Montesquieu and certain other <b><font COLOR="#943634">{26}
</font></b>authors. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text16"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note16">[+16]</a></font>
The thesis at the base of our geographical analysis is quite different, it is:
the historical fate of a people (ethnos), being the result of their economic
activity, is not determined by, but is linked with, the dynamic condition of the
landscape they occupy. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text17"></a><a href="sik1b.htm#sik1note17">[+17]</a></font>
This is not geographic determinism, but the historical geography essential not
for our philosophical constructs, but, on the one hand, to fill the gaps in the
authentic sources and, on the other, to disclose their falsity, that same
falsity from which we hope to squeeze the truth.</p>
