<h4 align="center">The Field in a System</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Ethnocoenosis.</font></i></b> Up to now, while ethnographers have built
classifications by type indicators, namely, language, somatic traits (races),
mode of carrying on the economy, religions, levels and characteristics of
technique, the gap between superethnoi and ethnoi has seemed unfillable. But as
soon as we draw attention to the systems links, it disappears. The place of
descriptive ethnography is being taken by ethnic history, which records both the
stable relationships between the varied elements of a superethnic system and its
interaction with neighbouring systems. And then it turns out that what were
considered abstractions, do really and ponderably exist. So, then, terms like 'Hellenic
culture' (including Roman possessions), 'the Muslim world', 'European
civilization', which has spread to other continents, 'the Middle Empire' (China
is ethnically an extremely mosaic country), or 'Eurasian nomad culture' (Turks
and Mongols) are not simply words but technically materialized and socially
formed designations for ethnic entities of an order higher than those accessible
to observer ethnographers.</p>
<p>In the period preceding the origin of writing, ethnic entities of this order
obviously arose no less frequently and passed through the same phases of
development, leaving after them memorials of flint chippings, middens, and
shards of ceramic vessels, and some-times also being preserved as 'tribes' in
inaccessible jungles or on separate islands.</p>
<p>But if that is so, then many isolated peoples, considered to be at 'early'
stages of civilization, with an extremely low level of technique, are the final
and not the initial phases of ethnogenesis. Such, for example, are the pygmies
of the tropical forests of Africa, the aborigines of Australia, the
palaeoasiatic ethnoi of Siberia, the Tierra del Fuegans, and the mountain people
of the Pamirs. The degree of adaptation to the natural conditions is so high
that it enables them to maintain their existence as part of the biocoenosis,
without resorting to improvement of tools and weapons. But this system of
relationships with natural and ethnic surroundings puts a limitation on growth
of population. That is particularly noticeable in New Guinea where the Papuan
youth, until recently, was not given the right to have a child until he had
brought in the head of a man from a neighbouring tribe, having learned his name,
because the number of names was strictly limited. In that way the Papuans
maintained their balance with the natural resources of the area they inhabited.
That was drive close to the zero level. In other respects they do not yield
place to dynamic peoples.</p>
<p>Persistent ethnoi as a rule constitute a stable system that includes besides
the total human stock, a certain number of elements of living nature and
technically organized inert matter. This means that the ethnocoenosis (as I call
the complex set I have described) includes, along with people, certain domestic
animals, cultivated plants, and things as objects of use. The Eskimos are
inconceivable without dogs, igloos, and kayaks, even when they attach internal
combustion outboard motors to them. The Tungus are associated with reindeer and
sled-dogs, Arabs with camels, Pueblo Indians with corncobs, and so on. If the
disturbance or breach of ethnocoenosis is not great, it only deforms an ethnos,
but if it is great it destroys it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, but far from always, disruption of ethnocoenosis causes the
extinction of an ethnos and, along with it, of animals and plants associated
with it. Often only the system is destroyed, while the components become part of
other ethnoi and ethnocoenoses. But it also happens that with complete
extinction of an ethnos, and disruption, of the ethnocoenosis, a recurrence of
ethnogeneses continues to be observed, with certain deviations from the original
type. That is called the succession of culture. The rhythms of Roman culture,
for instance, continued to be felt throughout Europe for many centuries after
disappearance of the Roman ethnos and after the Roman Empire perished. But if
that is so, then we come up against the concept of ethnic inertia. But inertia
is a physical phenomenon. And besides, how can there be inertia of a body that
has ceased to exist? Something is obviously missing in my analysis, which means
I must introduce a new concept. Anticipating the course of my thought, I say
directly that an ethnic field exists in nature, like the known electromagnetic,'
gravitational, and other fields, but! at the same time different from them. It
is not manifested in the individual reactions of separate people but rather in
the group psychology that affects the person.</p>
<i>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Ethnic field.</font></b></i> The principle of the field is realized
universally in the life of the individual and of the species, in all its
manifestations and in all its stages. But it is not hard to note that these
manifestations themselves fall into two categories. One embraces the processes
of the species' development, i.e. the transition of latent (potential) forms of
its existence to developed (actual) ones. The other consists (a) in the
behaviour of the elements of the organic whole (individual, colony, species),
which ensures its existence, its wholeness (living unity), as such, and (b) in
preservation of its form. In both these cases there is coordinated action of
numerous elements of the whole, i.e. the principle of the field is manifested.
But its object (individual) takes shape during development, i.e. it changes
continuously both morphologically and physiologically. In accordance with that
the field of development (the embryonic or morphological field) is also
distinguished by dynamicity. Any field of a developing organ or young developing
individual differs at any given moment from what it was the moment before. In
opposition to that, the field regulates the behaviour of the elements of the
organic formation, ensuring preservation of its wholeness, a relatively static
behaviour that underlies the type of the given group. Clearly, however, the
unity proper to the highest taxonomic groups is also extended to other aspects
of their being. For us this unity is not only displayed through form but is also
manifested through the behaviour of these groups in the evolutionary process in
which they are involved, each as something whole and united. The existence of
laws and patterns of the evolutionary process common not only to most organisms,
but that are also characteristic for separate groups, testifies to this quite
convincingly.</p>
<p>We can conclude, from the fact of the wholeness and the unity of groups,
expressed in the unity of their structure and behaviour in the evolutionary
process, that there are fields that govern and coordinate this process. One can
call these fields phylogenetic. Since the type of a group is its fullest
characteristic, we can see the essence of the evolutionary process in the
evolution of types of groups. The concept of type, moreover, gets a dynamic
meaning although it is still employed in a static sense. <a name="ebe6text1"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note1">[+1]</a></p>
<p>The studies of history, ethnography, and even of psychology thus enabled us
to return to nature study in the full sense of the word. Since people are part
of Earth's biosphere they cannot avoid the effect of biochemical processes that
affect their subconsciousness or the sphere of the emotions. And emotions, no
less than consciousness, push people to actions that are integrated into
ethnogenic and relief-shaped processes. As a result, a generation with drive
arises that loses the inertia of drive because of the resistance of the
environment and passes into a relict state of ethno-relief equilibrium that may
be disturbed by a new drive impulse, i.e. by a micro-mutation.</p>
<p>Supraindividual behaviour is most distinctly displayed in the collective
actions of social animals. In human society the actions of the group are
determined by an aim consciously set by the group or by its leader. Being guided
by this aim and having definite plan to achieve it, people build towns, develop
various branches of the economy, allocate the means obtained for living, and so
on. Social insects also build a common dwelling for the whole colony, jointly
gather and distribute food, bring up progeny, and so on.</p>
<p>The essence of the supraindividual behaviour of animals has not yet had
adequate scientific treatment. It is often called instinctive. But what does
that epithet explain? The theory of natural selection provides an answer to the
origin of instincts and to the origin of all the properties in general of
organisms. But (1) the explanation of these phenomena from the standpoint of
this theory is as little convincing as its explanation of the whole process of
evolution; and (2) knowledge of the origin of any phenomenon is not in itself
sufficient for understanding its essence. And I, too, will not attempt to define
precisely the nature of supraindividual behaviour and to answer what is the
origin of instincts. It is possible, at the present time, that we not only do
not have the factual data necessary for that, but even have not developed the
concepts themselves with which it is necessary to operate in this field. But
that win not pre-vent me from gathering facts relating to it, classifying them,
noting the observed patterns, and trying to interpret them, starting from the
general principles I have adopted.</p>
<p>In applying the principle of field to all the phenomena of an individual's
and species' life, we concretely imagine the objects of the field's action, The
reality of the individual is directly obvious to absolutely everybody. The
reality of the species is not perceived so directly. But it is also
unconsciously employed not just by biologists, since the concepts designating
species, such as dog, crow, adder, bream, are common in everyday life.</p>
<p>A species manifested itself as reality through its unity. But for anyone who
is concerned with systematics it is obvious that not only species but also
ethnoi are realities √ through historical unity, and community of historical
fate or destiny.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The rhythms of ethnic fields.</font></i></b>
The conception of the role of an ethnic field is set out here in such detail
because, when transferred to ethnology, it solves the most complicated problems.</p>
<p>We must agree on the meaning of the terms I am using. Even if they do not
accord in details with those adopted in contiguous sciences, they explain to the
reader ideas needed to understand what follows. Let us say that a field is a
continuation of the body beyond its visible limits and consequently that the
body is that part of the field in which the fines of force are so dense that
they are perceived by our sense organs. It is now established that fields are in
constant oscillatory motion from one frequency to another. These frequencies,
i.e. 'vibrating stimuli', G.I. Akinshchikova writes,</p>
<p>have the peculiarity that they am transmitted unhindered from one medium to
another and haw a common character of dissemination in solid, liquid, and
gaseous media. Vibrations in the air medium in the 16 to 20 000 Hz band am
perceived by man as sound stimuli. There are no special receptor organs in the
organism for perceiving vibration itself. <a name="ebe6text2"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note2">[+2]</a></p>
<p>She cites further data about the regime of normal vibrations for the
internal organs and about neurological and physiological disturbances caused by
the prolonged effect of vibrations on the organism. Among the vibrations
affecting man are fluctuations of the activity of organs-diurnal, monthly,
yearly, and long-term ones brought about by the influence of the sun, moon,
changes in the geomagnetic field, and other effects of the external environment. <a name="ebe6text3"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note3">[+3]</a></p>
<p>That observation alone is sufficient to interpret all the assembled
ethnological material. Only, it will be necessary to take the ethnic system as
the standard of investigation, i.e. to pass from the organismal to the
population level.</p>
<p>It is clear, starting from the data adduced, that the definite frequency of
vibrations to which a system (in our case the ethnic system) has been able to
adapt itself is the optimum one for it, on the one hand, and-on the other hand
is without perspective since there is nowhere and no reason to develop it.</p>
<p>But these rhythms are disturbed by impulses from time to time (in our case by
impulses of drive), and the system, reconstructed again, strives for a blissful
equilibrium, discarding elements that interfere with this process. At the level
of an ethnos an odd combination is thus observed of rhythms and excesses, bliss
and creation, the latter always being agonizing.</p>
<p>And yet, when speaking of outbursts of ethnogeneses in various regions, I
have rejected the rhythmicity of these phenomena not from general philosophical
considerations but simply because the hypothesis of rhythmicity is contradicted
by the observations. But fluctuations of an ethnic field (as I shall call it for
convenience of exposition) with one frequency or another may be equated with a
rhythm whose intensity changes during the course of ethnogenesis. Let me try to
explain this by an example. A string (or tuning fork) begins to sound after
being plucked (or struck), but its vibrations gradually weaken and the sound
dies away. But if it is plucked again, with different force, it will sound again
but louder or softer. And since there are no literal coincidences, and in nature
not a single string but a huge orchestra and an acoustic hall, all ethnic fields
are, dissimilar, although governed by one law, namely, damping of the original
impulse arising as a consequence of excess (micro-mutation). This explanation,
even if one considers it unproven (inductively), is confirmed by its explaining
all the known facts, which is recognized in the natural sciences as necessary
and sufficient.</p>
<p>We perceive the ethnic field described (or a phenomenon equivalent to it) as
ethnic proximity or nearness, or, on the contrary, as strangeness or foreignness.
The principle, characteristic for all ethnoi - the opposing of itself to all
others ('we' and 'not we') - that is manifested in direct sensation, can be
interpreted simply from the point of view proposed. When the bearer of one
rhythm meets the bearer of another, the new rhythm is perceived as something
strange or alien, being out of tune with the rhythm that is organically inherent
in the ethnos. The new rhythm may be liked, but the dissimilarity is registered
by the individual's consciousness as a fact that has no explanation, but about
which there is no doubt. And the rhythms of an ethnic field are manifested in
stereotypes of behaviour, inimitable, as I have already said.</p>
<p>Obviously it is' due to the existence of an ethnic field that ethnoi broken
up by historical fate and subjected to the effect of different cultures do not
fall to pieces. They can even regenerate if the causes disturbing the original
rhythm of the ethnic field are removed.</p>
<p>From that, too, stems an explanation of the phenomenon of nostalgia. A person
thrown into an environment of strangers, even though they are likeable people,
feels a strange awkwardness and melancholy. But these feelings weaken when he
finds fellow-countrymen, and disappear on returning home. Neither climatic
conditions nor the presence of comforts has any significance in that connection.</p>
<p>&nbsp;The interpretation proposed removes doubts about the primacy of
perception of ethnos. Since a biophysical phenomenon underlies ethnic community,
it is stupid to consider it a derivative of social, ecological, linguistic,
ideological, and other factors.</p>
<p>Now I can answer why newborn children are 'unnational', i.e. unethnic. The
ethnic field, i.e. the ethnos as such, is not in the bodies of mother and child,
but between them. The fetus is surrounded by a bio-field, but the child, which
establishes a link with its mother with its first cry and first swallow of milk,
enters her ethnic field, i.e. a modified one that is then shaped by communion
with the father, relatives, other children, and the whole people. But the field
is weak at the beginning of life, and if the child is put into another ethnic
environment, its field will be reconstructed, but not its temperament,
capacities, and possibilities. This will be perceived as a change of ethnic
membership, which happens relatively painlessly in childhood.</p>
<p>These considerations are strengthened by the data of psychology and pedagogy.
A person's personality is moulded during the first three to five years of his
life. According to Anton Makarenko, the Soviet educationalist, a child not
correctly or properly brought up before five will require re-education. Another
Soviet scholar, L.A. Orbeli, created 'an experimentally substantiated theory of
the maturing of unconditioned reflexes even after a child's birth under the
influence of the environment' . <a name="ebe6text4"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note4">[+4]</a>
And alienation of a child under three from its mother, or rather from the person
who is not so much flourishing as tender, attentive, and good, is very dangerous.
Such separation often leads to a lowering of intellect, anomalies of social
behaviour, heightened vulnerability, and aggressiveness. Clearly, it is not the
gene apparatus that operates here but the bio-field arising through communion -the
highest form of mental activity. What I have said is true not only of the person
but also of the system of a higher order, ethnoi.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The ethnic field and ethnogenesis.</font></i></b>
Above I explained only two aspects of the origin of ethnoi: the path of
splitting and the path of merging. But the main point of all √ the element of
creative becoming rather than the rearrangement of what is formed √ demands
attention. I have noted that the commencement of ethnogenesis al-ways coincides
with a flaring of drive. To employ a metaphor, one can say that the reaction of
synthesis only takes place at a high energy intensity, when the original
components, the ethnic substrata, instantaneously lose their structure and are
crystallized anew in hitherto unprecedented combinations.</p>
<p>I have established such periods of incandescence in the second century A.D.,
when the Byzantine entity, was created, and in the eighth century, when the
Muslim superethnos and the Tibetan and North Chinese ethnoi were simultaneously
formed, in the ninth century with the formation of the European mediaeval
nations, in the twelfth century with the birth of the Mongol and Jurchen ethnoi
and in the fourteenth century when the Great Russians appeared. Each emergence
was seemingly preceded by an incubation period, but it is impossible to disclose
and describe it by study of manifest history. But having established the pattern,
I can rightly draw the logical conclusion that not only did the recorded
historical ethnoi arise in that way, but also those ancient ones that are
preserved as relicts or are only mentioned in ancient sources.</p>
<p>It should be remembered that the history of mankind is not evenly illuminated.
But if the dynamic processes of the ethnogenesis of Palaeoasiatics, Patagonians,
Melanesians, or the Khoi-khoin are not known to us, there are no grounds for
considering that they did not have an acme phase. On the contrary, one can
suppose, from the pattern I have established, that all ethnoi have had their
heroic age and their flowering. But cruel time has blotted out the memory of
those epochs, because the traditional historical method is powerless where
tradition has been interrupted and broken off, and there: is no deciphered
writing. So we are limited by what it is possible, necessary, and for my
purposes sufficient to do.</p>
<p>It is impossible to explain these phenomena, and a host of similar ones, from
a premise of purposive behaviour and, consequently, of the existence of
conscious choice of their fate. Here we come up against subconscious, elemental,
spontaneous processes, that determine the behaviour of ethnic masses (statistically,
of course). The rhythm of the 'fields' of the Chinese and nomad superethnoi
differed so that friendly contact between them, even when dictated by political
considerations, was never firm and long. And that was no accident.</p>
<p>When a rhythm is combined with others either harmony or discord can
theoretically result. In the first case an ethnic merging occurs, in the second
the rhythm of one or both fields is broken, which weakens the links and leads to
a kind of annihilation.</p>
<p>But when there is an impulse or explosion of drive, the fields weakened by
mutual rivalry lose their inherent rhythms and acquire a new one previously not
theirs. The character of the new field depends on the force of the impulse (mutation),
on the topographical conditions of the region, on the genetic code of the
populations in the region, on the level of social development, on the stability
of the cultural traditions, and on the ethnic surroundings, either inert or
sharply hostile. Many more determinant moments can be counted, but here I shall
not briefly and hastily describe the impulses of drive and their consequences,
because it is better to do that separately. Ethnogenesis is initially a
strengthening, usually not very long, and then a gradual fading of the
fluctuating motion, while ethnic contacts are interference of the vibrations of
ethnic fields. And all ethnic history consists of take-offs and falls.</p>
<p>So, ethnogenesis is a natural process of the biosphere that is one of the
components of ethnic history and proceeds together with three constantly
operating factors: (1) the social, because people have always established a
certain order of relationships in their collective; (2) the technical, because
there is not, and has not been, a man without tools; (3) the geographical,
because the means of existence are derived from surrounding nature; and since
Earth's relief and topography are varied, the ecosystems, including people, are
also diverse. These three parameters are sufficient to characterize any
homeostatic ethnos, but the dynamics of ethnogenesis depends on a fourth, viz.
the impulse of drive that sometimes arises on certain sectors of the earth's
surface, and that generates not a single ethnos but a group of ethnoi, called
superethnos, i.e. a sys-tem in which the ethnoi are blocks, links, and
subsystems.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The nature of a superethnos.</font></i></b>
But still, what determines the closeness of the members of a superethnic system
to each other? Why are they capable of joining each other in creative bonds and
cannot ex-tend them beyond invisible limits into the area of another superethnos?
As we have seen, the disparity between different superethnoi is so great that
forced combining of them leads to demographic annihilation. In other words,
despite the fact that the French knights had been inspired by the morals of the
Arabs, by the erudition of the Greeks, by the courage of the Celts or the
Lithuanians, and by the indomitable energy of Polovtsy, only ethnic ruins have
arisen in the regions of contact. Figuratively speaking, if two massive solids
create friction during contact, then dust will be scattered -around that it is
already impossible to return to the former crystalline state. The processes of
destruction during contacts at superethnic level are irreversible.</p>
<p>But, for instance, there is also a diversity within a superethnos of (1)
socio-economic Structures, (2) races of first or second order, (3) languages,
(4) customs and ceremonies, (5) religions. Let us dwell on all these partial
attributes and characteristics consecutively, because a desire to take one
external attribute or another for the deep essence of the phenomenon constantly
arises.</p>
<p>The 'Christian world' at the end of the twelfth century employed many
languages, French, Provencal, Castilian, Galician (the same as Portuguese),
Basque, Breton, Tuscan, Neapolitan (there was no common Italian language), Saxon
in Southern England and Norwegian in Northern England, various German dialects,
Danish, Swedish, Polish, Czech, Hungarian, and Latin. Even in a big duchy or
small kingdom there lived people with different mother tongues, but that did not
prevent their communicating with one another. They learned the languages of
their neighbours, or employed Latin as the language of culture and religion.</p>
<p>In the 'Muslim world', too, Arabic, Persian, Turkish dialects, Syrian, and
Kurdish were used. In Byzantium, even in Constantinople alone, they spoke Greek,
Armenian, Slavonic, and Isaurian, and tried to write in Old Greek. <a name="ebe6text5"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note5">[+5]</a></p>
<p>The conclusion from that is unequivocal; as we have already seen, language is
not an ethnic attribute and different languages consequently do not prevent
mutual intercourse.</p>
<p>It is stupid to speak of a single economic structure of the super-ethnos of
the twelfth century because most of the population lived a subsistence existence
and contacts with neighbours, were consequently not needed. The liveliest
economic relations took place on the peripheries, precisely where mutual
annihilation took place. Economic life was quite intensive in the towns, but an
unfavorable growth of population was taking place in them. In congested and
unhygienic conditions any infection mowed down the mediaeval burgher, but the
town was again repopulated by arrivals from the countryside.</p>
<p>The races comprising superethnoi were very different and their combinations
haphazard. In the Crusades blue-eyed blondes from Normandy and Saxony,
green-eyed, auburn-haired men from Burgundy, lean black-eyed Provencals,
long-nosed Italians (descendants of Syrians settled in Lombardy already under
the Roman Empire), and Spaniards who could not always be distinguished from
Arabs, equally participated.</p>
<p>Among the Muslim troops could be met, side by side, Turkomans and Sudanese
Negroes, Hamites from the gorges of the Atlas, and Kurds from the slopes of
Ararat. And the Arabs themselves, with splendid Bedouin genealogies, had as
mothers or grand-mothers Georgians, Greeks, Italians, Sogdians, Indians,
Circassians, and Abyssinians. The racial composition only proved the scale of
the conquests and by no means the anthropological monolithic character of the
superethnos.</p>
<p>There was also no similarity of cultures or 'information communications'.
That was prevented in part by social barriers and the character of activity and
also, to no little extent, by territorial isolation. A-boy being trained as
knight or esquire had to be exercised in fencing and riding from six years old,
otherwise he would be killed in the first battle; one wanting to become a priest
crammed Latin; an apprentice toiled over a fabric or a potter's wheel; the
peasant boy herded cows and pruned vines. All were so occupied with their own
affairs that they never chattered with one another. And their professional
interests were so different that the need for 'information communications' was
insignificant. And though Northumberland was raided by Scots, the inhabitants of
Kent or, even more so, of Bordeaux did not care about that, even though the king
of both was the same. And the Caliphate broke up into territorial emirates with
ease, surprising the Arab themselves, although the link between the scholars of
these sovereign states was not broken. But is it that theology and philosophy
determine the commonality of an ethnos?</p>
<p>Besides it is only worth having a chat when different opinions are met. But
then debate and bickering arise. Such was the dispute of Bernard of Clairvaux
and the Cluny monks against Abelard and the Paris students. But that did not
undermine the wholeness of the Christian world.</p>
<p>Bernard was able to get the Catholic Church purged of illiterate priests and
profligate bishops, and recruited two kings for the Crusade (the French king
Louis VII and the German king Conrad III).</p>
<p>Abelard gave the Catholic Church a philosophical system, conceptualism, a
Pope (Celestine II), a heresiarch (Arnold of Brescia), 19 cardinals, and 50
bishops. When excommunicated he retired to the monastery of his opponents, Cluny,
where he died in 1142, reconciled with his persecutors. So what should be
considered a 'node of communications'? A quarrel right to the stake, or silent,
tacit agreement in the face of force? Or simply that information links are not a
factor of ethnogenesis but an indicator of separate aspects.</p>
<p>Even more terrible was the discussion raised in North Africa in the same
twelfth century by the Berber theologian Ibn Tumart against the Tuareg marabouts
(hermits) about the 'unity of god'. These simple-hearted, ignorant people
understood the likeness of God to man literally, in the sense that God had hands,
a face, and so on. Ibn Tumart began to spread a version that quite suited him: 'His
(Allah's) hand is a hand of some quality and his visage a visage of some quality,
for example hearing, sight', but what those hands were was in fact beyond human
understanding. <a name="ebe6text6"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note6">[+6]</a></p>
This would seem the right moment to establish communication information; but no,
the champions of 'unity', the Almohads, slaughtered the 'polytheists', the
Almoravids. The theological disagreement, hardly intelligible to anyone, can
scarcely be considered the cause of the bloodshed. The Berbers were simply
fighting the Tuaregs as, incidentally, it is accepted to consider.
<p>The dispute about the divine attributes did not die out in Muslim theology
for a thousand years, but it did not always lead to bloody consequences. On the
contrary, regular, destructive wars arose, and Were waged under other slogans,
for example in defense of the right of the descendants of Ali and Fatima to
exercise the duties of the Caliph. It is consequently not a matter here of
scholarly formulations but rather of something else that must be sought out.</p>
<p>But if we discard all the apparent causes of the monomorphism of superethnoi
then how can we explain the uniformity of the processes of ethnogenesis given
the mutual dissimilarities of the systems? There must obviously be an invariant
factor.</p>
<p>And there is. Let me describe it as follows: <i>the constellation of the
energy relations of space and time that deform the ethnic substrata of a region</i>.
Now let me explain what that means.</p>
<p>Imagine a wide tray with an uneven bottom, on one edge of which balls, of
different size and weight are strewn in a row. Let us touch this row with a
narrow trowel. The balls touched will roll away with various speed and the rest
will stay out. The rolling ones will gradually stop and assume a new imaginary
shape. If we touch the balls in another place, the figure will be different
because of the dissimilarity of the mass of the balls, their inertia, and the
uneven-ness of the surface on which they are moving. But the new figure, too,
will be the consequence of the shove.</p>
<p>Now let me translate the example into reality. The impulse of drive (micro-mutation)
embraces a certain region and sets the ethnoi living there into motion, which
dies out through loss of drive. When the movement begins new systems arise, in
relation to which the old ethnoi play the role of substrata. All the ethnoi of
the region affected by the impulse will change their relation with the terrain
that feeds them and with their ethnic surroundings (neighbors), which will
create an apparent diversity. But since they have all received one and the same
impulse, they will display features of similarity (moving in one direction).
That will unite them in a superethnos.</p>
<p>But can we compare a superethnos with a 'cultural sphere', or an ideological
conception arising simultaneously with the impulse of drive? The idea suggests
itself, but it is a temptation. Conceptions, philosophemes, aesthetic canons,
ethical standards, and so on, are not phenomena of nature but the work of human
minds. Like things made by human hands, these values (called 'spiritual') are
either preserved or destroyed by remorseless time. And al-though they are spread
by preachers and prophets far faster than the ethnoi that created them migrate,
it is inevitable that they will be deformed on new soil. Two examples should
suffice.</p>
<p>By the fifth century A.D. the Christian doctrine had spread from India to
Ireland and from the Caucasus to Ethiopia inclusive. And everywhere it triumphed,
but - the similarity achieved by heroic deeds and martyred preachers was limited
by dogma, by the details of the divine service, and by migrant literary subjects
like the leg-end of the Holy Grail. And this closeness was only a moment at the
peak of drive; then everything happened haphazardly. Egypt, striving for
spiritual independence, became Monophysite. Nestorians arrived in Mesopotamia
under the protection of the Iranian Shah. Rome itself, heading the new
superethnos, went its own way. And in Arabia Islam united in itself all the
heresies persecuted in Byzantium and successfully synthesized them in a creed
that became a symbol of the self-assertion of the Arabs. Cultural continuity
there was, but the natural process flowed past it, washing away all the dams
erected by people.</p>
<p>The fate of the Buddhist preaching was similar. This doctrine disappeared in
its homeland, Bengal, but took on such different forms in Ceylon, Japan, China,
Tibet, Siam, and Mongolia, that even the dogmatic basis was lost; only the
terminology and name of the Buddha, Shakyamuni, was preserved. This man,
incidentally, is also esteemed by Christians as St. Joasaph. Once again, as in
the legend of the Holy Grail, cultural influence does not signify ethnic
closeness.</p>
<p>The invariant of the superethnos thus lies in the sphere of geography and is
determined by the combination of the drive impulse and the topographical
peculiarities of the region. If the impulse affected two, three, or four regions
separated by geographical barriers, then a corresponding number of superethnoi
would develop, unconnected with one another. But these superethnoi, being of
identical age, would develop synchronously in contrast to others appearing
sooner or later. The collisions I have described, and ones like them, would
occur.</p>
<p>The substrata for a new ethnos are also neighboring ethnoi unaffected by the
drive impulse. The ethnic surroundings always influence the character of
ethnogenesis in any phase, with the exception of homeostasis. Each new ethnos is
consequently a by-product as regards the preceding ethnoi on its territory and
existing around it. On the other hand, the advent of a new ethnos inevitably
lays its mark on neighboring ethnoi -and their development, even when this
development is not broken by the activity of the newly appearing ethnos. The
mechanism of ethnic development is complex, but its principle should be clear.</p>
<p>No, it is not only benefits and material goods that form people's stereotype
of behavior. Their love and hatred are largely connected with the subconscious
elemental psyche, so that the words 'mine' and 'theirs' are not abstract
concepts but a sensation of really existing ethnic fields and rhythms. That is
why ethnoi and their aggregates - superethnoi - exist for a thousand years and
do not fall apart, like a house of cards, from chance puffs of wind or upheavals.
But when drive disappears, i.e. the force vibrating the ethnic field, the
symphony dies away and the ethnos (or superethnos) collapses of its own weight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
Chimeras.</font></i></b> It often happens
that ethnoi grow into and through each other. Within a superethnos that does not
provoke tragic consequences, but at superethnic level such metastases create
chimeric compositions <a name="ebe6text7"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note7">[+7]</a> that lead to death. The mechanism of the process looks as follows in outline.</p>
<p>The superethnic system arising in consequence of an impulse is closely linked
with the nature of its region. Each of its constituent parts and subsystems -
ethnoi and subethnoi - finds an ecological niche for itself. That gives them a
possibility to reduce the struggle for existence to a minimum and get a chance
to co-ordinate them-selves, which in turn facilitates the moulding of social
forms. Blood also flows in this situation, but not very abundantly, and it is
possible to live. But if a new, foreign, ethnic entity invades this sys-tem, it
is forced, not finding an ecological niche for itself, to live at the expense
not of the territory but of its inhabitants. This is not simply neighbourhood,
and not symbiosis, but a chimera, i.e. a combination in one entity of two
different, incompatible systems. In zoology the combination of an animal and a
helminth in the intestine is called a chimeral construction. The animal can
exist without the parasite, but the latter will perish without the host. But
living in his body the parasite takes part in his life cycle, dictating a
heightened need for food and altering the organism's biochemistry by its own
hormones, forcibly secreted into the blood or bile of the host or parasite
carrier. That is the difference between the chimera and the symbiosis, whereby,
for example, a hermit-crab carries an actinia on its shell, which defends it
from its enemies by its stings. The actinia, moving on the crab, finds more food.
With symbiosis at superethnic level both components feed on the gifts of nature
and coexist, which does not exclude episodic conflicts. But all the horrors of
superethnic clashes pale before the poison of a chimera at the level of a
superethnos. But cross-breeding at the level of an ethnos or subethnos can
engender either assimilation or a relict sub-ethnos, which does not have lethal
results.</p>
<p>Strong, drive-tense ethnic systems naturally do not tolerate out-side
elements in their environment. In Western Europe, therefore, chimeral
constructions were seldom met before the twelfth century. But they appeared in
the early thirteenth. As an example I would cite the state created by the Order
of the Brothers of the Sword in the Baltic area, who carried on military
operations with involvement of the warlike Livs, and who fed off the land by
turning the Letts and Kurshi into serfs. Neither the Livs, nor the Letts needed
a bloody war with the people of Pskov and the Lithuanians, but they were in a
system in which foreigners were their absolute masters, and there was nowhere to
take shelter. So they had to lay down their lives for an alien cause.</p>
<p>Another example of a marginal (border) chimera is Bulgaria. Around A.D. 660 a
horde of Bulgars, under the leadership of Asparukh, driven by the Khazars from
their native Caucasian steppes, captured the valley of the Danube, populated by
Slavs. The Bulgars were members of a Eurasian steppe superethnos, and their
symbiosis with the Slavs over the course of nearly 200 years was a chimeral
system. But the Bulgars were few in number; some of them dissolved into the
Slavonic medium, and some settled in the Dobruja and Bessarabia, i.e. in the
borderland. In 864 the Slavicized Bulgarian king Boris was baptized, which
marked the entry of his people into the superethnos I have conditionally called
'Byzantine'. But that only increased the number of elements in what was already
a non-organic ethnosystem without that. Together with Greek Orthodoxy,
Marcionitism, i.e. Bogomilism, arrived in Bulgaria from Asia Minor, by which the
ideological confusion within the country was increased. War with Byzantium took
on more and more cruel forms, until it was finished by the fall of the Bulgar
Kingdom in 1018. Only in 1185 were the Bulgars liberated by Asen, the leader of
the Wallachians, with the aid of Eurasian nomads, the Polovtsy (who were in a
symbiosis with the Bulgarians and Wallachians).</p>
<p>The institution of slavery is an element of partial ethnoparasitism. The
enslaving of another person has as its necessary precondition a conviction that
this person is different from the slaveowner. For the Egyptians and the
Anglo-Saxon planters he/she was a Negro, for the Romans a barbarian, for the
Jews the uncircumcised, for Muslims the kafir (infidel) and so on.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the institution of debt slavery has always met resistance,
which has been led by legislators √ in Athens by Solon, in ancient Israel by
the author of Deuteronomy, and so on; while the enslaving of foreigners was
considered natural even among the Tlinkites and Aleuts, hunters of marine
animals. Slave labor was not employed in that hunting, so the female slaves were
used for domestic service and the males were killed during the initiation ritual.</p>
<p>Let us recall that the Messenian helots were outraged not by their being
robbed and killed, but by its being done by the Dorian Spartans, who were also
descendants of the Heraclidae. That circumstance shocked the Greeks, although
they were all confirmed slave-traders.</p>
<p>If we change the initial point of reference, incidentally, it can be taken
that the native population of a country is a component part of the terrain that
the parasite ethnos exploits together with the animals, plants, and minerals.
But that point of view can hardly be accepted by anyone except persons
interested in this exploitation, and is constantly refuted moreover by history.
Although slavery is constantly observed, the separate situations of ethnic
parasitism have seldom been stable and lasting, but have often been reproduced
anew.</p>
<p>Interethnic collisions cannot be classed as either biological or exclusively
social categories, although the explanation I have suggested is a consequence of
the described phenomenon of drive, as a modus of the biochemical energy of the
living matter of the biosphere. Pour variants of ethnic contacts at the level of
a superethnos are possible, and it is clear that the determinant factor is the
degree of drive of the contacting ethnoi. If we observe a combination of a
persistent ethnos in which drive is not high with an ethnos with drive,
assimilation or ousting of the weak ethnos is most probable. If two or more
ethnoi of weak drive coexist, they will find a <i>modus vivendi</i>, and will
not overpower each other. If they have strong but equal drive, cross-breeding
will take place, the superimposition of rhythms deforming the stereotype of
behaviour and making it favourable for the individual to the detriment of the
collective; such collectives are usually annihilated, because each individual is
trying to five at the expense of the others. But if, when there is
cross-breeding, an impulse of drive occurs, the heightened lability of the
mutant populations will facilitate the rise of a new stereotype of behaviour, a
new structure, and consequently new variants of socio-political institutions, in
other words, of a new ethnos. That process can be compared with a chemical
reaction that begins only in the presence of a catalyst and at quite a high
temperature, and on the other hand with the creative process in psychology,
which arises in the sphere of the emotions (subconscious). it follows from this
that ethnic cross-breeding (by no means racial) cannot be unequivocally
appraised. In some circumstances of place and time it will kill the ethnic
substrata, in others deform them, and in a third case transform them into a new
ethnos. But it never happens without trace. That is why neglect of ethnology, be
it on the scale of state or country, tribal union, or monogamous family, must be
qualified as irresponsibility, criminal in regard to the offspring.</p>

<p>The Nature of Drive</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
Vemadsky's theory of the biosphere</font></i><font FACE="Times New Roman CYR" COLOR="#ff0000">.
</font></b>When we pose the question of the
energy essence of ethnogenesis, we must indicate what form of energy creates
these processes. But for that it is necessary to renounce certain Philistine
notions and replace them by scientific ones. Instead of the customary attitude
to one's self as an independent organism, even though constantly interacting
with other organisms,</p>
<p>we should denote living organisms as something whole and united, because they
are all functions of the biosphere, ... and an immense geological force that
determines it.</p>
<p>&nbsp; The organisms that populate Earth are not only an aggregate of
individuals, but also 'living matter' that</p>
<p>is connected with the surrounding medium by the biogenic current of atoms: by
its breathing, feeding, and multiplication. <a name="ebe6text8"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note8">[+8]</a></p>

<p>According to Vernadsky the biosphere is not only a film of 'living matter' on
the surface of the planet, but also all the products of its life activity over
geological time, i.e. soils, sedimentary and metamorphosed rocks, and the free
oxygen of the atmosphere. We walk upon the corpses of our ancestors, we breathe
the life of those who have been dead for ages, and we ourselves will go into
that element so that our descendants will breathe us.</p>

<p>Everything living is a continuously changing aggregate of organisms linked
together and governed by the evolutionary process during geological time. It is
a dynamic equilibrium that tends over time to pass into a static equilibrium...
The longer existence, if there are not phenomena of equal strength operating in
the opposite direction, the closer the free energy will be to zero. <a name="ebe6text9"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note9">[+9]</a></p>
<p>In order to understand this principle, we must take in yet another
circumstance. The inert matter of the planet is governed by the law of
increasing entropy. But living matter, on the contrary, has anti-entropic
properties. And all this diversity of animate and inert matter is connected by a
'biogenic migration of atoms' or by the 'biochemical energy of the living matter
of the biosphere'.</p>
<p>This form of energy is as real and active as the others studied by physicists.
And like them it is governed by the law of the conservation of energy, i.e. can
be expressed in calories or kilogram-meters. Our planet has been enriched by
energy over geological time by absorbing (1) the radiant energy of the sun, (2)
the atomic energy of radioactive decay, and (3) the cosmic energy of dispersed
elements coming from our galaxy. <a name="ebe6text10"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note10">[+10]</a></p>
<p>And this form of energy compels organisms to multiply and proliferate as far
as possible, just as a plate of duckweed, appearing in a pond in spring, has
covered its whole surface by autumn, right up to the natural boundary, the banks.
The same law of maximum spread operates for all living creatures of the
biosphere, and that means people, too.</p>
<p>But the biosphere itself sets limits to the organisms that are its components.
It is a mosaic; some species of animals or plants are limited by others, and a
harmony of life arises, a dynamic equilibrium of large or small-scale
biocoenoses. The climatic conditions on Earth are diverse. They are determined
by zonality, remoteness from oceans, change in the characteristics of
atmospheric pressure, and other causes. And consequently a need for adaptation
arises for organisms, ':that already limits spread territorially. The
neobiocoenoses, which can be interpreted as complex systems of animate and
inanimate elements, are therefore stable. Constant processes are going on in
them that ensure circulation of energy among the plants and animals of one
habitat, i.e. conversion of the biocoenosis.</p>
<p>But people are also part of the biocoenosis. The forces of the ethnic
community, which crowns the biocoenosis, are expended on overcoming, constantly
arising difficulties. In tranquil conditions the community lacks aggressiveness
as regards neighbors and is incapable of actively changing nature, which would
promote an in-crease in the number of its members through intensive reproduction.
So an ethnos is created as a system in which co-ordination of the individuals is
a condition of existence. But drive itself pushes people to mutual extermination
for the sake of predominance in the system, and then its tension falls until it
reaches zero. After that the inertia of motion rooted in social institutions and
traditions maintains existence of the system, but it is doomed and passes into
homeostasis. All 'arrested' ethnoi were once, of course, developing, and those
that are developing now WK if they do not disappear, become 'stable' one day.</p>
<p>The overwhelming majority of ethnoi, irrespective of their numbers, inhabit
or inhabited definite territories, forming part of the biocoenosis of a given
terrain and comprising together with it a kind of 'closed system'. Other ethnoi,
developing and multiplying, spread beyond their biochore, but that spread fished
by their being converted into ethnoi of the first type in the newly mastered,
but stabilized region of adaptation. There is a complete analogy with the cosmic
processes of thermodynamics:</p>
<p>In a closed system entropy is continually increasing. Consequently, an
organism [or a system of organisms or ethnos. -L G.] must systematically shed
the accumulating entropy. Animate matter must therefore be constantly exchanged
with the surrounding medium of energy and entropy. This exchange is regulated by
controlling systems, which employ stocks of information for the purpose. It is
quite improbable that the stocks of information arose spontaneously in the
organism or system; consequently they are passed on by inheritance. <a name="ebe6text11"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note11">[+11]</a></p>
<p>As I have shown above, the transmission of information by inheritance noted
by physicists is called 'traditions' in the language of historians, and 'signal
inheritance' in the language of biologists. Proceeding from everything noted
above, ethnogenesis is an energy process, and drive is the effect of the form of
energy that feeds ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
Mutations √ drive impulses</font></i><font FACE="Times New Roman CYR" COLOR="#ff0000">.</font></b>
Tranquil states of the geobiocoenoses, however, are not eternal. They are broken
by spasms of strange activity lethal for its bearers. Grasshoppers, peacefully
hopping about in a meadow, are suddenly transformed into a swarm of locusts that
flies to meet its death, destroying everything in its path. Tropical ants quit
their well-built nests and set out √ destroying everything they encounter √
only to perish on the way. Lemmings travel hundreds of miles to throw themselves
into the waves of the ocean. Micro-organisms ... they also act the same, causing
fatal epidemics. How are these strange phenomena to be explained? Seemingly, we
must turn again to Vernadsky's works on biogeochemistry.</p>
<p>The first biogeochemical principle reads:</p>
<p>The biogenic migration of atoms of chemical elements in the biosphere always
tends to its maximum manifestation. All the living matter of the planet is a
source of tree energy and can do work [in the physical sense, of course; and by
'free energy, Vernadsky understood 'energy of living matter which is displayed
in a direction opposite to entropy']. Because the development of free energy
capable of doing work is created by the action of living matter. <a name="ebe6text12"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note12">[+12]</a></p>
<p>Consequently our , planet received more energy from outer space than is
needed to maintain equilibrium of the biosphere, which leads to excesses that
give rise to phenomena among animals like those described above, and among
people impulses of drive or explosions of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>A necessary condition of the rise and flow of ethnogenesis down to its
attenuation (after which the ethnos becomes a relict) is drive, i.e. a capacity
for purposive supereffort. For the present I can ex-plain it only by recourse to
a hypothesis, i.e. an opinion that ex-plains the noted facts but does not
exclude the possibility of the appearance of other explanations. Drive is the
organic capacity of an organism to absorb energy of the external medium and give
it out in the form of work. In people this capacity fluctuates so strongly that
its impulses sometimes sweep aside the instinct of self-preservation of both the
individual and the species, because of which some people (in my terminology)
have drive, perform acts (and cannot but do so) that lead to a change of their
surroundings. This change equally affects the natural environment and the
relations within human communities, i.e. ethnoi. Drive, consequently, has an
energy nature that is refracted through mental features that stimulate a
heightened activity of the bearers of this attribute that creates and destroys
landscapes, peoples, and cultures.</p>
<p>My statement is by no means paradoxical. It is based on undisputed
propositions of physiology. Sechenov long since defined the role of the
environment as a physiological factor:</p>
<p>An organism without an environment that sustains its existence is impossible,
so that a scientific definition of an organism must include the medium that
influences it. <a name="ebe6text13"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note13">[+13]</a></p>
<p>And that includes the energy balance of the environment.</p>
<p>An organism gets the energy necessary for life activity, of course, not just
from food, which maintains the temperature of the body and regenerates and
replaces dead and dying cells. But respiration, too, i.e. the oxidizing
processes in the lungs, is no less important for the organism's life. The same
has to be said of the interaction with other forms of energy. electrical (ionization
of the integument), fight, radiation, gravitational. All these affect the
organism in different ways, but it is impossible to live without each of them.
The mechanism of the conversion of energy of the environment into energy of the
organism is therefore the subject of physiology. Some-thing else is important
for ethnology, namely, why are the fluctuations of activity so great in man, in
contrast to animals?</p>
<p>One can suggest two equally valid hypotheses here. An individual with drive
either absorbs more energy than normal, or (with equal absorption) directs it in
a concentrated way (unconsciously of course) to some aim or other. In both cases
the result will be identical-the individual's higher nervous activity will be
more vigorous than is characteristic for the normal individual, or peculiar to
the species, as such.</p>
<p>Thus, when social conditions determine the direction of a person's acts,
their energy will depend on the state of the organism including its genetically
conditioned attributes. So we come up against several problems of biology
concerning the rise of a new attribute that suddenly appears, and not as a
consequence of blending. This means that the explosion of drive (or the impulse)
is accompanied with a mutagen element that generates various divergences from
the optimum. But most physical and psychic monsters perish without consequences
for the population. People with drive, who are also products of mutation, are in
this sense an exception.</p>
<p>Roginsky and Levin, noting the low plasticity of racial attributes compared
with non-racial ones, nevertheless point out the existence even of racial
somatic changes that have arisen (cross-breeding apart) over the historical
period. <a name="ebe6text14"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note14">[+14]</a>
The change of characteristics comes about either through adaptation to new
conditions or through mutation. In the latter case a useful characteristic is
taken up, but a harmful one is rejected by natural selection. Drive is a
non-racial and harmful attribute, if not deadly for both its carrier and his
near ones. And here is why. When there are wars outside the country, people with
drive go on distant campaigns, abandoning their families and farms, which fall
into decay. So it was in Spain in the sixteenth century when the conquistadors
were fighting in Anahuac, Peru, and the Philippines, and regular troops in the
Low Countries and France. The lack of skilled workers was so acute that even
nails to build ships had to be bought in the Low Countries and Germany. But only
a century before Toledo blades had been considered the best in Europe.</p>
<p>But that is not the worst. With overheating by drive bloody internecine wars
often arose whose victims were not only the rivals but also their families. Such
were the Wars of the Roses in England, the Thirty Years' War in Germany, the
Hundred Years' War in France, and the 'Three Kingdoms' in China. In these and
similar wars, it was not those who fought who survived but those who artfully
knew, how to keep under cover. But the peculiarities of drive as an attribute
are such that it lingers on in a population through the existence of 'illegitimate
children', who inherit the biological but not the social features of their
parents. The presence then of systems links, both rigid (social) and corpuscular
(ethnic) increases the significance of an attribute for the system as a whole,
be it a 'social organism' or a superethnos. But the degree of effect on the
natural environment and ethnic surroundings not only depends on the level of
technique and engineering but also on the level of drive of the ethnos as a
whole, passing through one phase or another of ethnogenesis. What is more,
certain scientists consider that mutations do not embrace the whole Oecumene but
rather definite geographical regions.</p>
<p>There are grounds for suggesting that our ancestors had comparatively
brownish skin, black hair, and brown eyes, which are also characteristic of the
majority of ram at the present time. The most depigmented racial types √
blondes with light eyes √ most likely developed through mutations that are
concentrated mainly in Northern Europe on the coasts of the Baltic and North
Seas. <a name="ebe6text15"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note15">[+15]</a></p>
<p>But does this mutation differ in any way from drive impulses, except that the
latter arise rather more often?</p>
<p>One could get out of answering the question of the origin of mutations and
reasons for mutagenesis, without much fuss. Biologists themselves do not answer
it, justly citing as an excuse that the data they have obtained in experiments
are artifacts, and that it is not correct to transfer patterns traced in the
laboratory mechanically to what we see in nature. But my science √ ethnology
√ has an absolute chronology at its disposal, and one can get rather useful
results by means of this instrument.</p>
<p>Since I have equated the impulse of drive with a micro-mutation, we can
enrich biology with data that biologists can interpret from their own
standpoints, by studying the areas and dates of the impulses historically.
Biological micro-mutations and, in the language of ethnology, the formation of
superethnoi connected with drive usually embraces an area of the earth's surface
stretching north and south, or east and west, but sometimes the axis of the
upsurge of drive is at an angle to the meridian. <a name="ebe6text16"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note16">[+16]</a>
But whatever topographical zones there would be in these areas (mountains,
deserts, bays, gulfs, etc.), the territory remains monolithic. The relief and
the ethnic substrata only determine that on the territory embraced by the
outburst of drive two, three, or four different superethnoi may arise in one and
the same epoch. Transference of the attribute of drive through hybridization is
obviously ruled out since that would certainly be reflected in the
anthropological type of the metises. Land barriers also exclude cultural
exchange and borrowing through imitation. Both would easily be traceable in
works of art and material culture. Obviously, we are faced with a special
phenomenon that calls for special description. Remember, a new superethnos or
ethnos arises from an inevitable mixing of several ethnic substrata; but does
this not resemble a simple storage battery in which there must be zinc, copper,
and acid in order to get a current? That of course is a metaphor, but it
illustrates an energy process that is constantly fading because of the
resistance of the medium or environment. But if that is so, the impulse must
also be an energy one, and since it is not apparently linked with terrestrial
natural and social conditions, its origin may be extraplanetary. <a name="ebe6text17"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note17">[+17]</a></p>
<p>When one examines the area of an explosion of drive one gets an impression
that the globe is cut into strips by a light from one side of it, and that the
curvature of the planet has limited spread of the impulse. On the spot of the 'impact'
varied mutants appear, most of which are not viable and which disappear in the
first generation. People with drive are also abnormal, but the peculiarity of
this at-tribute is such that before it is eliminated by natural selection, it
leaves a trace in ethnic history, and to some extent in the history of art and
literature (since the two are linked with the ethnos).</p>
<p>One could. put forward other hypotheses as well of the origin of drive
explosions or impulses: chance fluctuations, the presence of a stray gene,
reaction to an exogenic stimulus. But they all come up against facts ' that
contradict them. It is not excluded that the hypothesis I have set out here will
not be confirmed, but that in no way affects application of the conception of
the energy character of ethnogenesis to vital problems of geography and history.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

Commissures of terrains.</font></i></b> Let
me come back to the problem of the relation of an ethnos and the terrain and
answer why a combination of two or more reliefs, two or more ethnoi, and two or
more 'social organisms', are necessary for the rise of a new ethnos. What is
that? A series of accidents? Or a regularity?</p>
<p>Analysis of the interaction of an ethnos (as an independent phenomenon) with
the terrain has shown that they are both linked by a reverse dependence, but the
ethnos is not a constantly acting landscape-forming factor and the terrain
cannot be the cause of ethnogenesis without an outside influence. The relation
then of the ethnic and social patterns even rules out feedback, because Earth's
ethnosphere is only the background for social development and not a factor of it.</p>
<p>In contrast to social laws, the decisive element for ethnogenesis is the
territorial one. The formation of peoples is polycentric; outbursts of
ethnogenesis are not associated with the peoples' culture and life, whether
developing or stagnant, and not with their racial composition, or the level of
their economy and technique, but are connected with special conditions of space
and time. The terrain does not of itself generate new ethnoi, because they
sometimes do not arise in some spot or other, even favorable, for whole
millennia. The regions of ethnogenesis are changing all the time. The process we
are concerned with begins now here, now there, which means that terrestrial
forces do not cause it (which I have already taken into account). We must
consequently look for the source of ethnogenesis in the environment of Earth,
and again turn to biogeochemistry.</p>
<p>Proceeding from my thesis of the nature of an ethnos as a system generated by
an outburst of drive, I have the right to define an ethnos as an energy
phenomenon. Since an incipient energy process always overcomes the inertia of
the preceding processes, it is natural that the lower the inertia the more
easily it is disturbed by an unexpected shock.</p>
<p>A monotonous terrain with a homogeneous ethnic population and traditions
uniting the people embodied in forms of political institutions, is a massif that
will react very little to a relatively weak shock. But with a combination of
varied terrains a combination of different modes of economy is inevitable. Some
people will catch fish at sea, others pasture cattle in the mountains, a third
group will sow corn in fields, and a fourth will cultivate vineyards in the
valleys. Even if they all have common ancestors, the need to adapt themselves to
different environmental conditions will make them rather dissimilar to each
other over several generations. And this dissimilarity will increase until the
systems links between them weaken, as a result of a gradual movement of society
that will take place simultaneously through the development of the relations of
production, which will, for its part, inevitably entail a restructuring and
reorganization of the obsolescent social system. If, as a consequence of the
historical vicissitudes of the ethnos, two or three states or tribal unions
arose, the stability of the system would be even less. The social and ethnic
lines of development are thus interwoven into a system.</p>
<p>These systems are very productive in the economic sense thanks to division of
labor and specialization. They have quite a good resistivity to the ethnic
environment, i.e. to neighbors that are trying to conquer them, because the
propensity to mutual exchange of products also extends to mutual help, but the
internal drive impulse, as a rule, overthrows them with astonishing ease. The
take-off moments of ethnogenesis are equally favored by a combination different
cultural levels, types of economy, and dissimilar traditions. A common element
here is the principle of variety and diversity, which can be interpreted in the
aspect interesting me. Imagine the ethnosphere as a combination of several broad
plates touching each other. This construction is struck by a downward blow.
Naturally, it is not the plates that will be broken first, but the contacts
between them, and then a chain reaction will start that deforms the plates
themselves. As an example, Byzantium and Iran were stable systems in the sixth
and seventh centuries, but the border region between them, populated by Arabs,
experienced their influence. A drive impulse moved the Arabs so that a group (consortium)
of followers of Muhammed was singled out. After four generations first an ethnos,
then a superethnos was formed from the Ebro to the Pamirs. Since the individuals
of the new mood interacted with one another, there immediately arouse an entity
that was emotionally, psychologically, and behaviorally single-minded, which
evidently had a physical sense. Here we most likely have a case of a kind of
single rhythm. It was that which was perceived by observers as something new and
unaccustomed, and not their own. Conquest is not the only form of ethnic spread
and drawing of other peoples into a system. There is transplantation of a
culture in the form of preaching of religion, and as an introduction of everyday
object or objects d'art that alter the system which is the object. The
Christianizing of the Eastern Slavs in 988 led to an extension of the
ethno-cultural area of Byzantium. The sale of opium and paraffin lamps in China
made her dependent on Great Britain and America, undermined daily life, and then
public authority, and finally the superethnic system of the Xing Empire, which
entailed not only political and social changes but also ethnic one, as for
example the assimilation of the Manchus by the Chinese.</p>
<p>An impulse of drive is thus necessary for the commencement of ethnogenesis,
but the diversity observed in reality is deter-mined by both the relief and
terrain, climatic features, ethnic neighbourhood and cultural traditions, and
the strength of the shock itself, i.e. the impulse. That is why all ethnoi are
original and inimitable, although the processes of ethnogenesis are similar in
character and direction.</p>

Thoughts about the noosphere.</font></i></b>
As I have already remarked several times, people's conscious, deliberate
activity plays no less a role in historical processes than their emotional
activity, but their character is different in principle. A disinterested
striving for truth gives rise to scientific discoveries that determine the
possibility of technical improvements, and so create the prerequisites for
growth of the productive forces. A passion for beauty shapes the mind both of
the artist and of the viewer. A thirst for justice stimulates social
reorganization. In short, 'human reason, which is not a form of energy but
produces activity as if responding to it', <a name="ebe6text18"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note18">[+18]</a>
becomes an impulse of the phenomenon called progress and is consequently
associated with the social form of the motion of matter. The link between these
two forms of the motion of matter, which are both present in every historical
event, great or small, is obvious. According to Vernadsky, 'the evolution of
species, which leads to the creation 6f forms of fife stable in the biosphere' <a name="ebe6text19"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note19">[+19]</a>
(the Second Biochemical Principle), and consequently directional (progressive)
development, is a planetary, global phenomenon.</p>
<p>But the fruits of human hands have a primordial difference from the creations
of nature. They drop out of the conversion of biocoenoses in which there is a
constant exchange of matter and energy that maintains the biocoenoses as
systemic entities. Human creativity wrests particles of matter from nature and
shackles form onto them. Stones are transformed into pyramids or a Parthenon,
wool into jackets, steel into sabers and tanks. And these objects lack
self-development; they can only be destroyed. Kalesnik drew attention to this
difference in principle between nature and technique in the broad sense, when he
also pointed out that not all man's creations possess these properties. A field
of wheat, an irrigation ditch, a herd of cows, or a domestic cat remains part of
the geographical environment in spite of man's influence. The anthroposphere
thus occupies an intermediate place between the dead technosphere and living
nature. But if so, they are in opposition. And this is a convenient place to
introduce Yu.K. Efremov's amendment to evaluation of the 'noosphere', which he
has called the 'sociosphere'. Is 'the sphere of the mind' really reasonable? For
it tries to slip into itself the living processes that enrich our planet with
stocks of the condensed energy concealed in soils and sedimentary rocks, in coal
and oil. The past fife of micro-organisms gave us the oxygen of the atmosphere
and the ozone layer that saves us from lethal cosmic radiation. The plants that
cover the land are a factory of photosynthesis processing fight into animate
matter. Animals, our lesser brethren, regulate biocoenoses and impart order to
them.</p>
<p>But what has the noosphere given us, even if it really exists? From the
Paleolithic, numerous flint chippings and accidentally dropped scrapers and
choppers; from the Neolithic -kitchen mid-dens at places of settlement.
Antiquity gave us the ruins of towns, and the Middle Ages the ruins of castles.
Even when ancient structures have survived to our day, like the pyramids or the
Acropolis, they are always inert structures going relatively slowly to wrack and
ruin. And you will hardly find a person in our time who would prefer to see
heaps of refuse and concrete squares in place of forests and steppes. But
technique and its products are the materialization of reason.</p>
<p>In short, whatever our attitude to the idea of the existence of a noosphere,
the polarization of technique and life is indisputable. And here we are faced
with the task of defining the relation of the drive that initiates ethnoi and
the sphere of consciousness that generates culture and technique.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p>Drive and the Sphere of Consciousness</p>
</b>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The frame of reference.</font></i></b> If we
take as our standard the impulse of the innate instinct of self-preservation
(1), individual and species, then the impulse of drive (D) will have an opposite
sign. The value of D may correspondingly be either greater, or less than, or
equal to the impulse of the instinct of self-preservation. Consequently, a
classification of individuals into those with drive (D &gt; 1), harmonious (D =
1), and of sub-drive (D &lt; 1) is legitimate. The ratio of these groups
determines the level of drive in the system, in my case in an ethnos. After a
drive impulse tension rises rapidly but 'overheating' sets in, after which there
is a slow, smooth decline, often with de-lays. If we were to plot a curve it
would record the inertial process. All the values would be positive; and the
limit, in practice unattainable, would be zero.</p>
<p>The overwhelming number of acts performed by people are undoubtedly dictated
by the instinct of self-preservation, either personal or species (the latter
being manifested in a propensity to multiply and raise offspring).</p>
<p>But drive has an opposite vector, because it forces people to sacrifice
themselves and their' posterity,, which are either never born or are held in
complete contempt for the sake of illusory aspirations (ambition, vanity, pride,
greed, jealousy, and other passions). We can consequently treat drive as an
anti-instinct or instinct with a reverse sip. And since there is no ethnos, and
cannot be, that is not associated with a primary outburst of drive, it is a
commensurate value for all ethnoi.</p>
<p>We can consequently classify all ethnoi by the degree of the growth and
decline of the drive of the ethnic field. The existence of fluctuations rather
complicates this principle, but not too much, because the scheme √ of a rapid
upsurge of drive and its slow depletion √ is real for all the ethnoi known to
me. It cannot be accidental. I can therefore consider the take-off moment of
ethnogenesis as the similarity of the impulse that communicates to the ethnic
sys-tem the inertia lost through the resistance of the environment.</p>
<p>Both instinctive and drive impulses lie in the emotional sphere. But psychic
activity also embraces consciousness, which means that we must look for a
division of impulses in consciousness such as could be compared with that
described above. In other words, they must be divided into a class of impulses,
directed to maintaining life, and another class directed to sacrificing life to
an illusion. For convenience of reference I designate impulses of life assertion
by a plus sign, and impulses of sacrifice, naturally, by a minus sign. These
parameters can then be developed in a flat projection similar to the usual
system of Cartesian coordinates, noting that positive does not mean 'good' or 'useful'
and negative 'bad'; in physics cations and anions; and in chemistry acids and
alkalis, do not have qualitative values.</p>
<p>One must note, in general, that only in the social form of the motion of
matter is there sense in opposing progress to stagnation and regression. The
search for a meaningful aim in the discrete processes of nature is an irrelevant
teleology. Just as mountain-building is in no way 'better' than denudation in
geology, and conception and birth are acts of the life of an organism in the
same way as death is, so there is no criterion of good in ethnic processes. But
this does not mean that there are no system, movement, and even development in
ethnogenesis, whereas there is no 'ahead' and 'back'. There is only rhythm in
any oscillating motion, and greater or less tension. So, let us agree on terms.</p>
<p>Only unrestrained egoism, requiring reason and will in order to realize
itself as an aim, will be a positive impulse. By reason we agree to understand a
capacity to choose a reaction in conditions permitting it, and by will a
capacity to act in accordance with the choice made. All tactile and reflex
activities of the individual are consequently excluded from this division, and
equally acts performed under the compulsion of other people or quite weighty
circumstances. But inner pressure - an imperative of either instinct or drive -
also determines behavior. And that means it has to be excluded, along with the
pressure of the ethnic field and traditions. For 'free' and 'egoistic' impulses
there remains a not very big but strictly demarcated field, in which a person
bears moral and juridical responsibility for his actions.</p>
<p>Here again we come up against the impossibility of providing a definition
unnecessary in practice. The collective experience of the human race dearly
distinguishes forced acts from crimes. Killing in self-defense is distinguished
from killing in order to rob or for the sake of revenge, seduction from rape,
and so on. In the middle of the nineteenth century attempts were made to
identify such acts, but that was groundless arguing. It is obvious in our times
that how-ever reasonable a person's concern for himself is, it does not give him
grounds for deliberately infringing the rights of neighbors or of the group.</p>
<p>A group of impulses with an opposite vector opposes 'rational egoism'. It is
well known to everyone, like drive, incidentally, but is also never singled out
in a single class. In all people there is a strange inclination to truth (a
tendency to form an adequate notion of an object), to beauty (what pleases
without preconception), and to justice (corresponding to morals and ethics).
This bent or inclination varies strongly in the force of the impulse, and is
always limited by a constantly operating 'rational egoism', but in some cases it
proves more powerful and leads the individual to death no less unswervingly than
drive. It is an analogue as it were of drive in the realm of the conscious, and
consequently has the same sign. I shall call it attraction.</p>
<p>The nature of attraction is not clear, any more, incidentally, than that of
consciousness, but its relation to instinctive impulses of self-preservation,
and to drive, are such as, say, the relation in a boat between the prime mover (oar
or motor) and the helm. 'Rational egoism'- the antipode of attraction - is
equally related to them.</p>

<p>We can therefore plot the classes of impulses I have singled out as follows:
subconsciousness, along the abscissa, and consciousness along the ordinate (Fig.
2).</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>But is such a complicated construction needed? And for what?</p>
</blockquote>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The relations of classes of impulses.</font></i></b>
There is no doubt about the biological nature of instinctive impulses. Both the
desire to live long, and the longing to re-create oneself through offspring are
biological attributes inherent in man as a species. But if that is so, the
attribute's value, in the sense of its effect on the actions of the individual,
must be stable, which means that, in each separate case, man's longing to live
is one and the same for all people living, who have lived, and who will live. At
first glance that contradicts observed reality.</p>
<p>In fact there are plenty of people who value life so little that they
voluntarily go to war; there are cases of suicide; parents often abandon
children to the will of fate, and sometimes kill them. And that is alongside of
deserters who dodge war, and those who suffer insults in order to save their
life, and parents who give their lives for children, who are often unworthy and
base. A vast spread of data! There would appear to be no system in the total of
observed phenomena.</p>
<p>But let me recall here the opinion of the ancients about heavy bodies'
falling faster than light ones. Only Galileo's experiment showed that the force
of gravity acts equally on a bit of fluff and a cannon-ball, and the difference
in rate of fall depends on an extraneous phenomenon, viz., the resistance of the
atmosphere. The same happens in the problem engaging my attention.</p>
<p>In Fig. 2 the reverse impulse of drive lies on the same line. In algebraic
summation it cancels out one part or another of the positive abscissa, and
sometimes even all of it. The magnitude of the impulse D (drive) can be less
than the impulse of instinct (the value of which it is convenient to take as
unity), equal to it, or greater. Only in the last case do we call a person one
with drive. With equality of the magnitudes, we have the ideally harmonious
individual, like Prince Andrei Bolkonsky in Tolstoy's War and Peace; D rather
less than unity is a Chekhovian intellectual; less still, simply a Philistine;
and after him come the sub-drive tramps and vagrants from Gorky' early stories.
Even lower we have cretins and degenerates.</p>
<p>But if the tension of drive is higher than that of instinct? Then the point
that designates the individual's psychological status is displaced along the
negative branch of the abscissa. There will be found the conquistadors and
explorers, the poets and heresiarchs, and finally resourceful figures like
Caesar and Napoleon. As a rule there are not very many of them, but their energy
enables them to develop furious activity fixed and recorded wherever there is
history. Comparative study of a small spread of events gives a first
approximation of the definition of the magnitude of drive.</p>
<p>We observe the same sequence in the conscious impulses plotted along the
ordinate. 'Rational egoism', i.e. the principle 'all for me', has a stable value
at the limit. But it is moderated by attraction, which is either less than unity
(for which I take the impulse of egoism or self-love), or equal to it, or
greater. In the last case we observe altruistic scientists and scholars, artists
who throw up careers for the sake of art, the law-lovers who defend justice at
the risk of their lives; in short, the type of Don Quixote in varied
concentrations. The real behavior of the individual we have the chance to
observe is therefore an amalgam of two constant positive values and two variable
negative ones. Consequently, only the latter determine the diversity of the
behavior categories observed in reality.</p>
<p>Properly speaking, all the impulses described above come under the definition
of 'dominant' accepted in psychology. But it is necessary for my purposes to
distinguish several definite dominants, and to pay no attention to the others,
for example libido, as without significance for my theme. And it is even more
important to establish the vectorial character of the selected dominants.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
Application of the conception to ethnogenesis. </font></b>
</i>The
proposed point of view and frame of reference yield little for study of the
psychology of the separate individual. Since the level of drive is an innate
attribute over a person's whole life, the ratio of the values does not change.
As for attraction, it changes under the impact of other people (teachers,
friends, pupils), and that means that its variability is a property of the group
and not of the individual. But when we are studying ethnogenesis, the principles
of the proposed conception are always convenient, though the results can only be
expressed in conventional, arbitrary ratios at the present level of knowledge
and possibilities. It is still beyond our possibilities to obtain numerical data.
But even what we have is still very useful for analysis.</p>
<p>We are well aware that all ethnoi pass through several phases of evolution
that are uniform in the ideal or the scheme. The many deviations from the scheme,
for example breaks of development, or shifts through outside interference, are
easily allowed for and excluded from examination of the main pattern. It is just
as easy to allow for them later during synthesis, i.e. in restoring the real
history of a people. Let us eliminate chance from the pattern, which will look
as follows from the angle of ethnology.</p>
<p>Let us take a group of different people as an example, and assume that we
know the drive and attraction of each of them. Then there will no longer be a
place for each on the axes of the coordinate, but on the plane between the axes.
A category of people of the same temperament, determined solely by
psychophysiological constitution, will be located in each quarter (see Fig. 2).</p>
<p>As will be seen from the drawing, the moral criterion does not attract
attention, which enables us to treat the proposed classification as a
natural-historical one providing a chance of examining the object objectively.</p>
<p>Suppose, too, that we have the data for plotting not just one moment on the
system of coordinates but, say, ten at intervals of a hundred years. We thus
obtain an expression of the variations of drive for the average period of the
life of an ethnos. If we had a chance to express the value of D in figures, it
would be simple to draw a curve of drive, and then find an equation
corresponding to this curve. But we still have to limit ourselves to
description.</p>
<p>That, however, also yields a lot for research. The saturation of a time
interval with events is always comparable with that of another interval. These
ratios are graphically expressed in detailed synchronistic tables, but they have
not drawn the attention of historians because a phenomenon reflected in them,
viz., fluctuations of drive, has not been taken into account. These tables have
now acquired sense and meaning.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The place of drive in historical synthesis.</font></i></b><i>
</i>It may seem that I have paid so much attention here to the description of
drive because I attach the significance of the decisive factor to it. But that
is not so. The theory of drive is given attention only so as to fill the vacuum
formed by one-sided study of ethnogenesis, not to replace the theory of the
primacy of social development in history, but to supplement it with indisputable
data of the natural sciences; that is the aim of the theoretical addition needed
for historical synthesis.</p>
<p>There is now sense in showing the relation between the four main groups of
causal effects on ethnic processes. Two of them are of the highest rank, and two
subordinate. In general form this will be a scheme, but it is precisely one
needed so as to separate the chance from the law-governed, which are constantly
associated in any historical and geographical discipline, because the one and
the other study variables that change in time and affect ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>The first and main factor of social development is growth of the productive
forces, as a consequence of which there is a change in the relations of
production and so in the organization of society. This global process is
generalized in a thorough, comprehensive way by the Marxian theory of historical
materialism.</p>
<p>A second factor, which determines not the impulse but the course of the
processes of ethnogenesis, is the geographical environment, ignoring of whose
role Kalesnik has rightly called 'geographical nihilism'. <a name="ebe6text20"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note20">[+20]</a>
But exaggeration of the significance of the geographical environment, i.e.
'geographical determinism', also does not yield positive results. Plekhanov
wittily showed that in his polemic with Labriola, when he remarked that</p>
<p>the Italians of today [at the end of the nineteenth century .- LG.] live
among the same natural surroundings as the ancient Romans did, yet how little
does the 'temperament' of the present-day losers to Menelik resemble that of the
stem conquerors of Carthage. <a name="ebe6text21"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note21">[+21]</a></p>
<p>It could be objected that the anthropogenic effect over 2 300 years had
altered the topography of Italy, yet nevertheless it is obvious that it was not
the replacement of the beech forests by lemon groves and thickets of maquis that
led the Italian army to defeat at Aduwa.</p>
<p>But these powerful factors, in combination, determine only the <i>'overall
trend' </i>of socio-historical processes and not 'the <i>individual features of
events and some of their particular consequences'.</i> <a name="ebe6text22"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note22">[+22]</a> But it is just such
trifles that often lead to the creation or the break-up of a consortium, and
sometimes to the preservation or dispersal of a subethnos, and are rarely, yet
all the same, reflected in the fates of ethnoi, and in exceptional cases may
even affect the forming of a superethnos. Quite abundant examples of these
historical zigzags that compensate each other in given segments of history were
given by Plekhanov in the work cited, though exclusively from the history of
Europe. The reader will find similar data from the history of the Far East in my
<i>Steppe Trilogy</i>. <a name="ebe6text23"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note23">[+23]</a><font FACE="Arial CYR"></p>
</font>
<p>One can thus single out a factor of lower rank √ the logic of events √ in
which allowance is made, for short chains of causal connections, in themselves
law-governed, but which are chance affairs for a process of higher rank. These
short regularities, in turn, that are constantly broken in the course of
history, depend on accidents of a second degree, and so on. <a name="ebe6text24"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note24">[+24]</a></p>
<p>These variations can be ignored When global processes are being surveyed, for
example, the succession of formations, but it is necessary to allow for them in
ethnogenesis. And it is here that the role of outbursts and fluctuations of
drive comes out; they are related to the forming of the biosphere like the logic
of events to the social form of the motion of matter. In other words, the role
of drive in ethnogenesis is less than 25 per cent, but ignoring of this amount
yields an appreciable error that confuses the results. And a miss is as good as
a mile. Let me therefore continue the description of the phenomenon I have
noted.</p>
<p>So far I have only described drive as a biologically inherited attribute,
employing examples from the history of different periods. We have thus seen that
history, as a science, provides a chance of tracing certain laws of the
phenomena of nature. Consequently, history can be useful not only in itself, but
also as an auxiliary discipline of natural science. So far, though, it has not
been employed for that purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
Generalization.</font></i></b> All the
observations and generalizations of them adduced above help draw attention to
the non-coincidence of the social and ethnic rhythms of development. The former
is spontaneous continuous movement along a spiral, the second is discontinuous,
with constant flashes and outbursts whose inertia is dampened by the resistance
of the environment. Chronological social shifts (changes of formation) and
ethnogenetic processes do not coincide in any way. Sometimes an ethnos, for
example the Russian, experiences two or three formations, and sometimes it is
created and disintegrates within one, like the Parthians, for example. Mankind's
social development is progressive, but ethnoi are doomed to disappear.</p>
<p>One can now draw a conclusion. Ethnogenesis is an inertial process in which
the initial charge of energy (the biochemical, described by Vernadsky) is
expended through the resistance of the environment, which leads either to
elimination or to ethnic equilibrium with the terrain and the human
surroundings, i.e. conversion into a relict, viz., a vestigial (persistent)
state, lacking creativity. It is through high intensity of drive that the
interaction between the social and natural forms of the motion of matter takes
place, just as certain chemical reactions only take place at a higher
temperature and in the presence of a catalyst. Ethnoi are created and maintained
by impulses of drive (the biochemical energy of living matter refracted by man's
psycho-nervous organization), and disappear as soon as the tension of drive
slackens.</p>
<p>In conclusion I must clarify how far the conception of ethnogenesis
corresponds to the theory of dialectical and historical materialism. It fully
corresponds to it. The development of social forms is spontaneous; the change of
socio-economic formations is a global phenomenon in spite of the unevenness of
development in different regions; the motion of the social form of matter is
forward and progressive; its direction is a spiral. Consequently it is a
philosophical theory of the general laws of development, and of course a whole
order of magnitude higher than the anthroposphere taken as a whole, and two
orders higher than the ethnosphere, i.e. the mosaic of ethnoi in time and space.
In other words ethnology is a partial case of the application of dialectical
materialism, allowing for the specific nature of the theme and aspect. All
natural laws are stochastic, of course, and consequently are governed by the law
of large numbers, which means that the higher the order; the steadier the action
of the law on the object; and the lower the order, the more the role of chance
increases and so the degree of freedom.</p>
<p>In the first case the limit is the Galaxy, in the second the atom, because
supergalactic and subatomic phenomena are investigated by different means and
are otherwise perceived by our consciousness. But between them lies a gradation
of the orders of phenomena. And each order requires attention and an approach to
itself.</p>
<p>Ethnology is somewhere around the mean. The type of motion in ethnoi is
fluctuation; development is inertial and discrete; stability s ensured by
systemic links and ties, and uniqueness and creation by the effect of the
biochemical energy of animate matter refracted by the psyche, i.e. by drive.</p>
<p>Such, in my opinion, is the definition of the concept 'ethnos'. It is an
elementary concept, not reducible either to social or to biological categories.
That conclusion is an empirical generalization of historical and geographical
facts.</p>

<p>From historical geography to ethnic psychology.</i></b>
Just as it is bad for a person to live outside an ethnos, it is bad for him to
live outside the natural conditions he is accustomed to, made fit for his needs
by his ancestors. I have described the mechanism of the rise of anthropogenic
landscapes, and its connection with the phases of ethnogenesis. This quite rigid
link also depends on the collective tuning of the ethnic system that forms the
ethnocoenosis, development of which is associated, as we now know, with the
level of drive and also with the character of the adaptation to the terrain, and
the presence of some ethnic dominant or other. With such an approach to the
subject of study, the Eurocentric idea of the superiority of technical
civilization over the development of other types, it goes without saying, loses
its validity. In fact, why consider the agricultural culture of India or the
hunting culture of the Eskimos of Canada less perfected than the mode of life of
the inhabitants of urbanistic agglomerations? Is it really only because the
latter are customary for the majority of my readers?</p>
<p>&nbsp; But if we are to break with Philistine subjectivism, we shall need a
reliable criterion for comparing ethnoi and superethnic cultures, because they
cannot in fact be considered wholly equivalent to one another. For that purpose
we must turn again to an examination of the features of ethnogenetic processes
and, without limiting our-selves to a simple description, provide an
interpretation on the basis of the drive I have discovered, in which the phase
of ethnogenesis and change in the state of the anthropogenic landscape will be
correctives for each other.</p>
<p>That the difference of ethno-psychological stereotypes is determined by the
climate, relief, flora and fauna of the places of ethnic development was known
long before Montesquieu. These ideas al-ready figured among the Arab geographers
of the tenth to fourteenth centuries, being the foundation of geographical
determinism; their incorrectness then consisted not in their falsity but in the
inadequacy of the explanation of the observed phenomena. The geographers of that
trend did not allow for the main point, viz., the dynamics of
ethno-psychological mentalities and dispositions, which changed uniformly and in
a regular way over centuries. Let me explain this by graphic examples from
Russian literature and history.</p>
<p>The Russian, or rather Great Russian, ethnos has existed a long time. Even if
we do not accept the mythical Rurik and the no less mythical Oleg and Igor, the
direct ancestors of the Russians were in any case already recorded after the
Tatar invasion, somewhere at the beginning of the fourteenth century. They were
the same Russians, but did they really behave as modern Russians do? Well, not
quite the same. When Pushkin, for example, was insulted, it seemed the right
thing to fight a duel. But no Russian today fights a duel when he is slandered
or nasty things are said about his wife. Are we a different ethnos than
Pushkin's contemporaries because we behave differently? Perhaps that should be
answered in the affirmative √ but perhaps not? Because intuition says that
Pushkin was the same kind of Russian person as we are. The change in the
stereotypes of behavior seems quite natural to us. Because three hundred years
before Pushkin, in the reign of Ivan the Terrible, when there was no dueling,
and duels were not known in general, how did the merchant Kalashnikov, for
example, behave when his wife was insulted by the Oprichnik Kiribeevich?
Lermontov described it quite accurately. Kalashnikov seized the right moment,
and in an honest fist fight delivered a foul blow to the temple. He killed the
offender, sacrificing his own life to do so. From the point of view of people of
the time of Pushkin and Lermontov that was a gross baseness. They did not act
so! If you got into an honest fight, you should fight honestly. But from the
point of view of Kalashnikov▓s contemporaries, he acted absolutely correctly,
and even Ivan the Terrible himself said:</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>As for thee, brave heart, on the block shalt thou<br>
Thy wild head lay down by the Tsar▓s command;<br>
I will have the blade made keen and sharp,<br>
I will have the headsman wear fine, rich dress,<br>
The great bell for thee will I bid them ring<br>
That all Marrow-town, all the folk might know<br>
That thy Tsar to thee of his goodwill gave... <a name="ebe6text25"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note25">[+25]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>But two hundred years before that no one would have tried in general to kill
his insulter, especially if the latter was of high social standing √ a duke or
an influential boyar. An insulted man-at-arms or member of the bodyguard, a
priest or a free peasant simply went off to another duchy. If they treated him
badly in Moscow, he went to Tver. And if they treated him badly in Tver, he went
to Suzdal; and if he didn▓t like it in Suzdal he went to Lithuania. Quite a
different reaction to insult.</p>
<p>As if they were different ethnoi. But we know that it is one ethnos and that
we have met a phenomenon here not statically fixed, but processes of
law-governed changes. Each phenomenon has to be taken with its past and with the
outlook for its future. One can doubt that such nuances of behavior as reaction
to insult have any significance for geography, but there are equivalent
phenomena, though less clear, that actively shape the anthropogenic landscape.</p>
<p>I have already established that different ethnoi relate differently to
nature, but even one and the same ethnos carries on its economy by different
means in different phases of its ethnogenesis, and so influences the enclosing
terrain differently.</p>
<p>The architecture not only of towns but also of separate settlements,
moreover, even of houses and farm buildings, is a component part of the
anthropogenic landscape. And that it depends on the character of the activity of
the people of a given ethnos is understandable without proof.</p>
<p>So-called ▒national character▓ is thus a myth, because it will be
different for each new epoch, even when the continuity of changes of the phases
of ethnogenesis is undisturbed.</p>
<p>The changes take place steadily, not being functionally connected either with
modifications of the geographical environment or with the succession of
socio-economic formations, though constantly interacting with both. But this is
interference of the ▒independent variables▓ that are interwoven in the
historical process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
Objections.</font></i></b> When history is
treated as a function of time and all the preconceived notions and prejudices
associated with it are rejected, it will appear that time does not behave
uniformly, but now this way and now that. That statement is so unaccustomed that
it is necessary to agree on the terms, because the definitions proposed here
relate only to historical▓ time but do not affect Newton▓s or Einstein▓s
mathematical conceptions and biological time counted by the succession of
generations of the species studied. One must also not apply the features
described below to geological time, since inert matter has its own laws. We
shall limit ourselves to the specific features of man and of the character of
his formation. That, too, is no little matter.</p>
<p>Historical time, in contrast to physical (extended), biological, and relative
(continuum), is revealed through saturation by events. What we call ▒time▓
is a process of equating energy potentials that are sometimes disrupted by
explosions (shocks) that restore the in-equality of energy potentials, i.e.
diversity. The impulses arising in the biosphere because of these shocks are
creativity manifested in a striving now for beauty (art), now for truth
(science), now for justice (morality), now for power (thanks to this impulse
states are created), and for victory (be it the conquest of a foreign country or
the ephemeral success of an operatic tenor), and everything similar. These
impulses may be positive, i.e. life-asserting, sparing everything living and
valuing everything created by the hands of man, and negative, separating energy,
information, and matter, in which information finds refuge. A negative impulse
withdraws quants of energy from the bounds of time - and that is the real end of
the process. But a positive impulse reunites energy with inert matter, receives
information, and the world continues to exist all over again. Everything
inimitable and beautiful disappears with loss of the energy charge. That is why
the losses are so great in ages saturated with acts and deeds. But Memory
opposes death, and the collective memory of ethnoi is the history of culture.</p>

Rises and falls.</font></i></b><font FACE="Times New Roman CYR" COLOR="#ff0000">
</font>According to the theory of progress
there are neither the one nor the other. It has become customary, and not
without certain grounds, to consider that the western peninsula of the Eurasian
continent has particularly great significance in the history of mankind. As
evidence the flourishing of classical Greece, Alexander the Great▓s campaign,
the creation of the Roman Empire, the brilliant painting of the Renaissance, the
great discoveries and colonial conquests of the sixteenth to nineteenth
centuries are cited. But; it is forgotten, with that, that the listed
▒flowerings▓ were episodes, not just on the background of world history but
also on the canvas of the history of the Mediterranean basin. The flourishing of
Greece was, essentially, the short-term hegemony of Athens. Alexander▓s
victories evolved the return blows of the Parthians, Saki, and Indians, and
caused the collapse of Macedonian independence Rome - but I shall speak
specially about her. And as regards the victories of the Spaniards, French, and
English over red-, black-, brown-, and yellow-skinned overseas ethnoi, taken
unawares, it is now already obvious how ephemeral the conquests of the
conquistadors, adventurists, and traders were.</p>
<p>The troubled times about which European historians do not like to write, but
which have been the object of my analysis, were rather longer. The declines of
culture are just as important phenomena of history as its rises and upsurges.
Where, then, do the whole centuries without art, literature, and philosophy
start from? Let me explain.</p>
<p>In ages of frequent migration of whole peoples to other countries, with
mutual rejection and non-acceptance of others▓ cultures, and with contacts at
superethnic level, the conditions for the preservation of memorials of art were
extremely unfavorable. The heritage of Roman antiquity was preserved only under
the ground, from which it began to be dug up by humanists in the fifteenth
century. The marvelous icon painting of the time of the upsurge of Byzantine
culture fell victim to the iconoclasts. The magnificent gold and silver
ornaments of the Ugrians, Alans, people of Rus, and the Khazars were melted down
into coins and ingots and dispersed to the ends of the Oecumene. Wonderful
embroideries, fine paintings on silk, rich brocaded clothes moldered away with
time, while the heroic tales and myths of the origin of the cosmos were
forgotten together with the languages the rhapsodes recited them in. That is why
the age of the first millennium A.D. is called ▒dark▓, ▒troubled▓,
▒cultural stagnation▓, and even ▒barbarity▓!</p>
<p>The roundabout way, through the history of events, has shown that this epoch
was creative, tense, and tragic, and that it was not barrenness of spirit and
reason that determined the observed emptiness, but the flame of hearts and
passions that reduced everything that would bum to ashes.</p>
<p>Anyone starting to study the global patterns of ethnic history must
immediately disavow the principle of Eurocentrism, which seems to many not to
require proof. In fact, from the sixteenth century to the early twentieth,
European peoples grabbed half the world through colonial operations and the
other half by the export of goods and ideas. The last-named also brought them no
little in-come.</p>
<p>The advantage of Europeans over other peoples was so obvious in the
nineteenth century that Hegel constructed a philosophy of history on a principle
of world progress which had to be realized by Germans and Anglo-Saxons because
all the inhabitants of Asia and Africa, the aborigines of America and Australia
were ▒unhistorical peoples▓. But only 150 years passed and it became clear
that European predominance in the world was not the road of progress, but an
episode. America and Australia, as overseas extensions of Europe (Western), were
directly linked with the same line; similar lines were traced out among ancient
peoples, where they went to their natural end.</p>
<p>In other words, the peoples that it is accepted to call backward, are simply
relicts that have outlived their flourishing and decline. One can say that the
black Australians, the Bushmen, and even the Eskimos, are old ethnoi. That is
why their material culture is so poor, and their spiritual culture so
fragmentary. Ethnogeneses are discrete processes; therefore the concept
▒age▓ is proper to ethnoi.</p>
<p>Very much has been said and written about the aging of peoples; historians
usually understand this terminology as a metaphor. In fact, children are born
and generations are consequently renewed, so what then can age? That is just
what I have been trying to show, starting this time from concrete
ethno-psychology, obvious for any historian or ethnographer with broad vision,
rather than from general considerations of systems theory.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<b><i>
<p><font COLOR="#ff0000">
The principles of reference.</font></i></b>
It is sensible to base the age classification of an ethnos (any one) on an
element that no system can get along without, viz., the relation of the
collective to the individual. Any group limits the freedom of each of its
members by the need to allow for the other members separately and for the
interests of the group as a whole. An ethnos is no exception to the general
rule, but the character of its effect on the persons composing it changes in the
course of time, and a certain pattern is traceable in the changes.</p>
<p>A striving to conserve the relations between its members is characteristic of
an ethnos in a static state. In a gentile society, for example, there is a rigid
despotism of tradition, that fixes the place of each newborn child in life and
the limits of its possibilities, no attention being paid to the level of
personal capabilities. If a hero or a genius, for example, is junior in
seniority to a cretin, he must, all the same, be considered lower in social
position, and even may not live to the time when his talents would be employed
by the collective if some extraordinary calamity like a cruel war with neighbors
or an infection, when it would be necessary to treat dying fellow-tribesmen, did
not come to the aid of the junior. But even then an exception would only be made
for the savior of the tribe, and the principle of seniority would remain
uninfringed.</p>
<p>Such an attitude to the individual does not just exist in gentile society. It
finds clear expression, in the developed class society, in the caste system or
attenuated expression in the system of estates. In any of these variants the
collective fixes the place of the individual and requires only one thing of him,
viz. contentment with him-self and his position, because that is the main
psychological condition for the preservation of relations. This position, it
would seem, does not deserve either approval or admiration. But I shall not be
so categorical.</p>
<p>A static ethnos is guided by the same principles in its attitude to the
nature around it. Nature feeds it, yielding up to it the abundance of her
wealth, and the ethnos dictates to its members not to require more of nature
than a given amount. In a forest 10 per cent of the trees die annually as a
result of natural selection and the struggle for existence, which means that
this 10 per cent can be cut for fuel and building, and not more. Similarly, the
increment of a herd of ungulates can be culled for food without harm to
reproduction.</p>
<p>And how exactly tribes of Sioux or Blackfeet knew how to determine these
norms in respect of bison! The hunt was a social affair for them and any
high-handedness was stopped by very harsh measures. Because of that the ethnos
and its enclosing territory were in a state of dynamic equilibrium
(homeostasis), that enabled people, animals, and plants to exist together for an
unlimited time. But we know that this balance was achieved in any case (be it
Africa, Australia, or Greenland) through an ethnogenesis that occurred at one
time, and was its final phase.</p>
<p>History, alas, is useful only to him who learns from it. Otherwise Philistine
▒common sense▓ proclaims the disastrous conception of the conquest of living
nature. In 1894 the American geologist and anthropologist W.J. McGee wrote:
▒In the subjugation of the animals of the earth, men preserve only those that
can be enslaved, and all others are slain▓ <a name="ebe6text26"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note26">[+26]</a>
And it is very noteworthy that only the Sioux put forward an opposite
conception, affirming that ▒everything the power of the world does is done in
a circle... With all beings and all things we shall be as relatives.▒ <a name="ebe6text27"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note27">[+27]</a>
The conclusion is unambiguous, the Sioux were guided in their practice by the
concepts of ▒geobiocoenosis▓ and ▒biosphere▓ although they called them
differently, while civilized scientists, who are at the level of the views and
opinions of their time, and are held in thrall by them, have preached that man
displayed his power</p>
<p>by transforming the face of nature, by making all things better than they
were before, by aiding the good and destroying the bad among animals and plants
and by protecting the aging earth from the ravages of time and failing strength. <a name="ebe6text28"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note28">[+28]</a></p>
<p>The idea that they themselves, since they had bodies, were a component of the
nature whose face they were vigorously altering, which their grandsons are
melancholy about now, was foreign to that American scientist and his
contemporaries. Nevertheless the cult of force reigned then, which enabled
Fairfield Osborn to say in 1949 that it was in fact a history of reckless,
uncontrolled human energy. This energy √ the drive of the system √ has swept
away not only plants and animals but also the Indians themselves, whose way of
life and behavior were not understood and rejected by the bearers of this idea.
The Americans therefore considered ▒savages▓ those whose natural philosophy
had outstripped their own for 300 years. As a consequence the Indians, who had
managed to find an ecological niche in the biocoenosis, perished together with
them, because they were justly treated as a component of nature, subject to
reorganization.</p>
<p>As soon as individuals of a new temperament create a new ethnic entity, they
put forward a new principle of communal life, and a new imperative of behavior:
▒be what you should be▓. The king should behave like a king, the man-at-arms
like a man-at-arms, the servant like a servant because, without rigid
subordination, the new system would fall apart during a clash with an external
enemy or with fellow-tribesmen who preferred the old order.</p>
<p>It may seem that the difference between the first and second principles is
not all that great, but that is not so. In the molding of a dynamic ethnos the
category of duty to the collective plays a primary role, and not right of birth
as it had been before that. The king who did not answer to his position should
be suspended or I killed and replaced by someone worthy; a bad knight should be
exiled, a bad servant flogged. There were no rights, but there were obligations,
for which rewards were proposed. The latter might be different: sometimes money
(benefices), sometimes the right to hold a profitable post, sometimes the chance
to share power with the rulers. But the decisive factor of attaining prosperity
was any-how the business principle, and not right of birth.</p>
<p>A newly arising intraethnic system is usually inclined to aggression, the
victims of which are neighbors. If the latter are strong, the system gets broken
by their resistance; if they are weak the system triumphs and ethnogenesis
proceeds rapidly. But there is a latent danger here, not so much for individuals
of the new type as for the principle that carries them to victory over
fellow-tribesmen and neighbors. Or rather the victory itself is the greatest
threat. As soon as most of the problems are solved, duty begins to burden people
and a new (third) principle takes the place of the old one: ▒be yourself.</p>
<p>When the man-at-arms wants to be not just the duke▓s arms-bearer, but also
a Remuald or a Bertrand, and the monk not simply recites the texts of the
Scriptures or says the Mass, but annotates or comments on what is read, risking
an accusation of heresy, and the artist signs a picture, and the merchant does
not simply seek out new trade routes but institutes a firm under his name, and
the peas-ant not only defends the rights of the community but declares ▒When
Adam delved and Eve span, who then was the gentleman?▒, that is when a
generation appears that breaks the shackles of the imperative of duty, just as
earlier the chains of the right of birth had been broken.</p>
<p>In place of the force of duty comes the right of force limited only by the
need to allow for the neighbor's also being strong and no less aggressive. The
test of strength between neighbors, converted from collaborators into rivals,
inevitably leads to bloody clashes, aggravated by the exasperation of the main
mass, who are not ready for the development and do not want to be the object of
the ambitious strivings of the members of the new generation.</p>
<p>The accumulated abundance of wealth and the decision of urgent foreign policy
tasks free a certain number of people from a considerable part of their
obligations, and then a strengthening of individualism begins, tacitly
formulated by the collective in that period as an imperative- be not only the
tribune who performs his duties, but also a Gracchus; not only the knight but
also a Pierre Bayard; not only a member of the boyar duma but also a Vassily
Shuisky; that is to say, individual features and peculiarities are manifested
even more than involvement in public affairs. Previously these people had put
all their forces into service to a cause determined by the cultural dominant.
This difference is very characteristically traceable in art. In the Middle Ages
the author of a work did not put his name on it, so that the builders who
erected 286 architectural masterpieces are not known; in the age of the
Renaissance the authors were brilliant personalities and were always known. And
perhaps that is why, only, the ▒Renaissance▓ seems a ▒blossoming▓ to us.
Indeed it is easier for the art historian or critic to write about one artist
than to analyze collective creation.</p>
<p>But the development of individualism leads to a clash between active
individuals, a bloody one for the most part. Within an ethnos, and often in a
superethnic community (culture) fierce rivalry arises, absorbing forces that up
to then have gone to dealing with external tasks. As a result the number of
brilliant individuals is reduced and life becomes simpler.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth to fifteenth centuries the drive of the ▒Christian
world▓ reached its peak phase, which was very unfavorable for culture and even
for the political system. The war of the Guelphs and Ghibellines led to the
death of the chivalrous Hohenstaufens and the ▒Avignon captivity▓ of the
Popes, i.e. to turmoil of the Empire and humiliation of the Church. The
Crusades, i.e. the first attempt at colonial expansion, finished in an immense
defeat all round. The Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Latin Empire disappeared
al-together from the map of the then world, and the Livonian Order, although it
survived, was converted from a bridgehead of European knighthood in the assault
of the east into a tiny feudal possession on territory that neither Lithuania
nor Rus disputed with it.</p>
<p>Such a ▒flowering▓ usually provokes a reaction, i.e. a striving to limit
the strife and killing. That is also encouraged by the fact that members of the
generations of individualists so intensively kill one another that the
proportion of them falls, while one of them, winning, slightly modifies the
principle of communal life, proclaiming ▒Be like me▓. This means: ▒I am
great, and you (addressing anyone) should copy me, because refusal to do so is
sedition or heresy; but you may not and dare not either surpass me or compare
your-self with me, because that is sedition and insolence; and you dare not try
not to resemble, because that is insolence, and in the final count also
sedition.▓ But there is no place for sedition in the newly organized
collective, because the epoch just passing has so com-promised violence that the
overwhelming majority prefer any regulation that makes it possible to expect
defense against the despot-ism of the strong.</p>
<p>Sometimes the victor and the legislator are an actually existing person,
Octavius Augustus and his successors, for example, but often they are an
abstract ideal of a person who should be emulated or whom it is necessary to
imitate. In either case the sense of the matter is not altered, and variations
of the relation between physical and moral coercion are non-existent for
ethnological analysis.</p>
<p>In spite of the external differences, ▒flowering▓ and the subsequent
situation, which is usually called a ▒civilization▓, are not different
phases of ethnogenesis. According to the principle enunciated above, which must
be consistently observed, a phase of development is determined by appearance of
a generation of individuals with a new psycho-nervous disposition. But here we
observe only a change of proportion between already existing mentalities. A
▒civilization▓, as a phase of development, is a time favorable for the
accumulation of material culture, for the regulation of living, and an
obliterating of local ethnographic features inherited from past epochs. It is a
time when the diligent Roman Philistine- Augustus▓ ▒golden mean▓ - begins
to flourish. The Philistine▓s mentality is met at all stages of the
development of an ethnos, but in the early ones he is suppressed and kept down
by the knights or individualists. Here they coddle him, because he has nowhere
to creep, nothing to gain, and is ready to revere the lord, so long as he is
left in peace.</p>
<p>Healthy ▒Philistine▓ cynicism inevitably follows a rebellious, mutinous
epoch. In Europe it found verbal embodiment in the thesis Cuius regio, eius
religio (whose the region, his the religion), when Catholics and Protestants
ceased to distinguish each other -- the supreme manifestation of indifference.
In Byzantium such weariness set in under the Macedonian dynasty and the Ducas
(eleventh century). Then the Empire, defended by brave Slavonic varangs <a name="ebe6text29"></a><a href="ebe6a.htm#ebe6note29">[+29]</a> and capable Armenian
officers, throve and waxed fat and √ went downhill. In the culture of Islam
civilization was the epoch of the Timurids, Sefewids, and the Great Moghuls; in
China it was the time of the Yuan and Ming dynasties; in Rome the principate,
crowned by the reforms of Diocletian. For the old Near Eastern Orient the role
of reconciliator was taken on by Cyrus, king of the town of Anshan, and the
Achaemenid Empire was the phase of civilization, i.e. the dying away of passions
and accumulation of material wealth.</p>
<p>As is seen from this brief, far from full list, the phenomenon of
▒civilization▓ in the sense indicated is characteristic of all peoples that
did not perish before reaching that age.</p>
<p>The system described should, it would seem, be extremely stable, but
historical experience indicates just the opposite. It was the ▒civilized▓
empire of Nebuchadnezzar that the prophet Daniel likened to a colossus with feet
of clay (an image that became classical). All the ▒civilized▓ empires listed
above fell with staggering ease under the blows of small, 'backward' enemies.
Local reasons can be found for each separate case, but there is obviously
something general lying in the causative depth and not on the surface of the
phenomenon. Let us go into it.</p>
<p>In the ▒Christian world▓, in fact, there was not even a shadow of
agreement. Kings ignored Papal bulls. Barons fought each other, paying no
attention to the proclaimed ▒God▓s peace▓, i.e. the truce decreed by the
Church. Manichaean Cathars preached in the towns; in the countryside pagan rites
were observed. And everyone struggled for himself and not for proclaimed and
incontestable principles. But the integration of this mass of various strivings
and aspirations built up into an ethno-cultural dominant manifested not within
the superethnos but on its boundaries, in struggle with unbelievers and
schismatics.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth to eighteenth centuries there was a splitting of this
relation to the surroundings; another simplification of the sys-tern set in that
wiped out the provisional boundary. In the nineteenth century an elementary
thirst for enrichment, a kind of vulgarized greed, became a feature of the
stereotype of behavior.</p>
<p>Remember that the conquistadors and the corsairs took a deadly risk, only a
few survivors bringing home gold to throw about in taverns. In the nineteenth
century risk was avoided and incomes were put into banks. The wars of the
Huguenots against the League were replaced by voting in parliament; and duels
became safe because they were stopped at the first wound. In the eighteenth
century wars had already been converted into the political actions of rulers and
affected only the soldiers. Sterne made his famous journey through France at the
height of her war with England; and it did not occur to anyone that he, a
writer, had any relation with the military operations. Even Napoleon▓s
conquest of Europe met with popular, i.e. unconscious-impulsive, resistance only
in ▒backward▓ countries like Spain and the Tyrol, where medieval traditions
were preserved. And Russia was victorious in 1812 in spite of the enemy▓s
threefold preponderance in number of troops.</p>
<p>A law and order was established in Europe supported by custom and not by
force. Thanks to the achievement of orderliness, it became possible to subjugate
all America, Australia, Africa (with the exception of Abyssinia), and India, and
economically China, Turkey, and Persia. Technical civilization was extremely
developed, subordinating some of the scientific disciplines, and art and the
humanitarian sciences were considered a necessary luxury for which some money
(but not much) was not grudged.</p>
<p>In short, in place of the extinct Pax Romana arose the Pax Europaica with
overseas extensions, the cause of the flourishing of the one civilization and
the other being a lowering of drive √ from the maximum to the optimum, right
down to the turning point, after which it moved to the minimum.</p>
<p>With that I come to the end of my excursus, because according to the
condition set at the beginning of my study, I am avoiding the aberration of
proximity by which recent events seem more significant than old ones, i.e. the
scale without which any study will be meaningless is violated. It is expedient
only to compare the analogous magnitudes, i.e. other superethnic systems. I have
therefore had to resort many times during the exposition of my conception to
antiquity and the Near Eastern Middle Ages for examples, so there is no need to
repeat them here.</p>
