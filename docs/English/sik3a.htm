<h3><a name="sik3para07">7. The Courage and Ruin of King David (1143-1218)</a></h3>
<h4>Reflection In a Mirror</h4>
<p>When a historian describes some period, event or even an
episode, he involuntarily regards it from a single angle. This is not prejudice,
tendentiousness, or injustice, but the inevitable law of selecting a point of
view, a feature of human perception. Yet it introduces into research a certain
onesidedness which often evokes unjust censure by the profane who are not versed
in the secrets of the trade.</p>
<p>So it is in our case: the Mongols, united by Chinggiskhan,
created a power which embraced half the world. Therefore, almost all historians
who have devoted their labours and strength to studying the thirteenth century
have written the history of the Mongols and their conquests. But our subject
obliges us to do something else, and we shall try to write a history of the
Naiman and their defeats. The facts will be the same, as will the sources. The
research method will not be changed either, but, despite this, we shall be able
to see events in a different light because we shall look at them from the other
side.</p>
<p>First of all, our view on how nomadic feudalism was
established will change. The Khitan in Manchuria had an organised feudal state
with a bureaucracy of literate Chinese and with a tax-liable estate.  <a name="sik3text1"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note1">[+1]</a>
The troops Ye-lu Dashi led to the west retained only an elementary military
organisation: they no longer had property, or lands, or serfs; in a word, they
had nothing but their weapons. After their victories they obtained a certain
source of income in the form of tribute from the Muslim towns and the grazing
grounds they took from the local population. It might seem that here they would
turn the conquered Kangyui and Kipchak into serfs and squeeze from them the
means to maintain a luxurious court and grandees. But Ye-lu Dashi <b><font COLOR="#943634">{132}
</font></b>was not so stupid. He clearly understood that he had
few people, but many enemies and the only way to salvation was by acquiring the
sympathy of the local population. So he only made them close up a little so that
there was room for his people, too, in the steppe and the foothills. He managed
to do this the more easily because an intensive increase in moisture in the
steppe zone of Eurasia took place in the twelfth century  <a name="sik3text2"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note2">[+2]</a>
and the amount of pasture grew as a result of the change in natural conditions.  <a name="sik3text3"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note3">[+3]</a>
Thus, peace was established in the steppe and the consolidation of the nomads
became possible.</p>
<p>It is also characteristic that the gurkhan hindered the
development of an aristocracy. No single officer dared command more than a
hundred warriors. The terrible experience of the fall of the Liao Empire was too
fresh; then, shaky discipline had made the Jurchen victory easier. Now, the
gurkhan alone commanded an obedient force. Well, where is feudalism here? No
feudal lords, no serfs, no hierarchy, only an army and families.</p>
<p>Inancha-qan, to all appearances, was in exactly the same
position, a man so ambitious that the rank of commander of a hundred did not
satisfy him. There are always those dissatisfied with those in authority, and
beyond the mountain range of the Mongolian Altai they were beyond the sphere of
action of the Kara-Khitan system. Fortunately for them, here there was a thin
population of the once strong, but now degenerated, Tikin tribe. <a name="sik3text4"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note4">[+4]</a>
The Naiman (as their neighbours called them, using a nickname instead of an
ethnonym) knew that in the new land they were surrounded by powerful and alien
people, so, along with the territory, they accepted into their milieu the
remnants of the Tikin. An army always needs additional men.</p>
<p>Inancha-qan died in 1201-2 and his army broke down into two
hordes ruled by his two sons, Tayang-qan and Buyiruq-qan. The brothers did not
get on with one another, but the cause of this, it seems, was not so much their
characters as the wish of their troops. In a military democracy the khan depends
more on the mood of his <b><font COLOR="#943634">{133} </font></b>warriors
than the warriors on the khan's caprices. From of old the Khitan had loved the
tribal structure and the decentralised system called a &quot;union of
tribes&quot;. Deprived of both as a result of Ye-lu Ambagan's decisiveness, they
had to obey khans converted into emperors. But as soon as the empire fell and
ordinary members of the tribe came to power, the Khitan fugitives returned to
their customary forms of social life and divided into two khanates (there simply
would not have been enough people for eight).</p>
<p>Thus, we can state that, among the Khitan who survived the
rout, a simplification of life, culture and social relations took place. They
returned to their natural condition, became brave hunters and herdsmen, forgot
Chinese literacy and, in so far as they retained a demand for writing, they
borrowed an alphabet from the Uighurs and one, incidentally, much more suited to
their language than the characters. With the alphabet came an ideology -
Nestorianism, which quickly displaced the survivals of concepts which had not
taken root among the people. The first consequence of the split in the khanate
was that the gurkhan Julqu and Inancha Bilge-qan began an independent policy at
the same time, thus paralysing one another and freeing the hands of their
numerous enemies.</p>
<p>The forces of the Kara-Khitan gurkhan were completely
fettered by the need to retain Central Asia where Khwarizm had grown in strength
at this time. This page of history had been described in sufficient detail  <a name="sik3text5"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note5">[+5]</a>
and we shall not dwell on it.</p>
<p>Let us return to the Naiman. Their western boundary was
reliably covered by the Altai. The Naiman established friendly relations with
the Kipchak who lived west of the Altai and neither people disturbed the other.
Relations in the east were much more complex. The Kerait, who had accepted
Nestorianism in 1007-8, occupied the central part of Mongolia. Their history
prior to the twelfth century is not mentioned at all by the sources. A legendary
genealogy derives the first khan noted by history, Markuz (Mark), who bore the
title Buyiruq-qan,  <a name="sik3text6"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note6">[+6]</a> from the first mother of the Mongols, Alan-goa.  <a name="sik3text7"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note7">[+7]</a>
We shall not digress by checking how far the legend corresponds to the history;
the only thing important to us is that the Kerait considered themselves close
relations of the Mongols. After <b><font COLOR="#943634">{134} </font></b>the
death of the Mongol Qabul-qan, great-grandfather of Chinggis-khan,
 <a name="sik3text8"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note8">[+8]</a> Markuz headed the nomads in their struggle with the
Jurchen, but fate dealt with him extremely severely. The Tatars captured him and
handed him over to the Jurchen. Markuz perished, nailed to a &quot;wooden
ass&quot;. This event is dated in the early 1150s.  <a name="sik3text9"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note9">[+9]</a></p>
<p>Markuz had two sons: Qurchaqus-Buyiruq-qan, it seems, headed
the true Kerait, and the second, bearing the title gurkhan,
 <a name="sik3text10"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note10">[+10]</a> a union of Kerait and Mongols, because from this time
there appeared among the Mongols their own sovereign, Qutula-qahan. Qurchaqus
died about 1171  <a name="sik3text11"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note11">[+11]</a>
and his heir, To`oril, marked his ascent to the throne by executing his uncles.
This caused a disturbance among the people and the gurkhan dethroned his nephew
who turned to the Mongols for help. Yisugei-ba`atur, Chinggis's father, then
heading the united Mongol tribes, came to the help of the prince who had been
driven out and restored him to the throne. The gurkhan fled to the southern
borderlands of the Gobi, to the Tangut,  <a name="sik3text12"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note12">[+12]</a>
and there received from them a place to settle his adherents.</p>
<p>Two lines influencing the course of historical events are
reflected in this at first sight insignificant episode: a state one determined
by a general Asiatic policy, and a personal one connected with the character of
To`oril, the Kerait khan. As only a combination of both lines of analysis can
throw light on the picture of historical reality, we have to distinguish them
and deal with them in turn.</p>
<p>About 1170 it was clear to all steppe dwellers able to
consider and evaluate the circumstances that a terrible threat hung over their
homeland. The indomitable Jurchen, after founding the Jin, i.e. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{135}
</font></b>&quot;Golden&quot;, Empire, strove for what their
descendants, the Manchu, achieved 500 years later - dominance over Asia. But
what the Manchu realised without great difficulty in the seventeenth century,
using the influence of the Lamaist church with which they cooperated,
encountered powerful resistance from the Nestorian church which had experienced
the horror of the Chinese persecutions (about a.d. 1000). Therefore, all the
nomads apart from the Tatars were against the penetration of the Jurchen into
the steppe. Even the Mongols, who were by no means Christians, actively
supported the Nestorian bloc. These forces would have been sufficient to halt
the aggressor, the more so since the main Jurchen forces were tied up in China,
but obstacles arose in the steppe itself, thanks to which the idea of active
defence remained unrealised.</p>
<p>Let us look at the situation. It would seem that the natural
leader around whom the nomadic and sedentary Christians might cohere was the
Kara-Khitan gurkhan; but Ye-lu Dashi had died and his heirs were engaged in a
policy directed by Uighur merchant capital.  <a name="sik3text13"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note13">[+13]</a></p>
<p>For the Uighurs conflict with China, whatever government
raged there, was the kiss of death since they grew rich from the transit caravan
trade and, in the event of a conflict, would not get the goods they needed. For
this reason they directed the Kara-Khitan blow at their Muslim competitors, at
Central Asia, and did not finance their attempts to turn their weapons to the
east.</p>
<p>The situation in Tangut was still more complex. The long war
with China had become a tradition of enmity, but the appearance of a mighty
Jurchen army and the over-free behaviour of the Jurchen as regards their agreed
obligations compelled the Tangut government to review the situation and to
support the anti-Jurchen forces, both in the south, in China, and in the north,
in the steppe. That was why they accepted the Kerait gurkhan, i.e. the claimant
to the command of the united nomad forces. But there was no single point of view
in the Tangut kingdom itself, and an advocate of an alliance with China was
executed at the request of the Jurchen in 1168, although <b><font COLOR="#943634">{136}
</font></b>his opponents did not achieve an alliance with the Kin
(Jin) Empire against the Song Empire and the Mongols.  <a name="sik3text14"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note14">[+14]</a></p>
<p>But more than anything, that very tribal system which they
defended with all their strength hindered the unification of the nomads. And now
is the time to pass to the personal sympathies and antipathies of the steppe
leaders on whom the freedom of their peoples depended. For each one of them,
whether he understood the general situation or not, had his own interests and
only wanted them to coincide with those of society. In the contrary case,
particularly when it was a matter of life, no one would sacrifice himself; more
precisely, he would not allow his competitor to kill him only so that an
abstract steppe freedom might not, in a decade or two, become a victim to
Jurchen ambition. Such was To`oril.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Naiman and Kerait</h4>
<p>To`oril's life story was a very difficult one. The Merkit
captured him when he was seven years old and the khan's son pounded millet in a
mortar, since prisoners were generally used as domestic servants. His father,
however, was able to attack the Merkit and save his son. Six years later To`oril
and his mother became prisoners of the Tatars and he pastured camels, but on
this occasion, without waiting for help from home, he fled and returned there.
These two facts themselves indicate that all was not well in the Kerait
headquarters. His enemies could twice capture the khan's son, only with the
connivance of the khan's relatives and grandees. This, in part, explains the
enmity which To`oril began to show to his uncles, a rancour which led to their
execution. Dethroned again in 1171, he acquired his rights only with the help of
the Mongol leader Yisugei-ba'atur, but was then deprived of his sole friend who
was poisoned by the Tatars in the same year. Even from this brief material one
can see that, in the Kerait headquarters, tribal unity had long been lost, and
authority rested on the spears of the retinue directed for good or evil by their
leaders. Only their creed bound together a people who were falling apart, for
the Kerait were surrounded on the north by pagan Mongols, and on the south by
the Buddhist Tangut. When the Naiman khanate of the same faith arose in the
west, the situation became still more tense.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{137} </font></b>To`oril`s enemies found a
point of support. From the point of view of the morals and duty sell-evident in
the twelfth century, no one could reproach the Kerait grandees with sympathy for
the Christian khan, the enemy of the hated Jurchen. Opposition to To`oril
emerged among the Kerait and Inancha used the situation for his political aims:
he concluded an alliance with the powerful northern tribes: the Oirat living on
the slopes of the Western Sayan, and the Merkit occupying the southern shores of
Baikal. It seems he even succeeded in attracting the Tatars, who had quarrelled
with the Jurchen, into the coalition and in establishing diplomatic relations
with the Ongut or &quot;White Tatars&quot;, descendants of the bold Shato, who
engaged in nomadism along the Chinese Wall between the Ordos and the Xing'an
range.</p>
<p>To`oril was isolated and compelled to seek support from the
Mongols, but this people had experienced a &quot;period of considerable division
and was not yet a single whole. The greater part of the Mongols, led by the
Tayichi`ut clan, were friendly with the Naiman and made no haste to help the
unlucky Kerait khan. But another part concentrated around Yisugei-ba'atur's son,
Temujin, who had taken the title of Chinggiskhan in 1182, supported To`oril. The
causes of such an unexpected turn of events are so essential that we shall have
to make a special analysis of the social changes which brought them about. For
the time being we limit ourselves to stating that To`oril and Temujin even went
so far as to conclude a temporary alliance with Altan-qan, as they called the
Jurchen Emperor, translating the Chinese name of the Kin (Jin - the word means
&quot;gold') Empire into Mongolian.</p>
<p>In 1183 the allies made use of the plight of the Tatars, whom
the regular forces of the Jurchen had attacked, to dissuade these plunderers
from their constant forays. Temujin and To`oril struck at the retreating Tatars,
killed their leader, shared the prisoners and, in addition, received Chinese
titles used in the Jurchen Jin Empire as thanks for their help.  <a name="sik3text15"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note15">[+15]</a>
From this time To`oril became Wang, but since the word <i>wang </i>(king) was
incomprehensible to the nomads, they added to it the well known word <i>khan. </i>Thus
was the title Wankhan [or Ong-qan in its Mongolian form - tr.] arrived at which
the Europeans took as king John.  <a name="sik3text16"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note16">[+16]</a></p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{138} </font></b>How could the Naiman react to
this? Only very negatively! Instead of a Christian alliance of nomads against
the aggressive and invading Jurchen, a pro-Jurchen Mongol-Kerait bloc had been
formed, and both rulers, Ong-qan and Chinggiskhan, acted despite the wishes of
their peoples. Thus, immediately after the victory over the Tatars Chinggiskhan
exterminated the powerful and numerous clan of Jurkin because they had not taken
part in the campaign as they were late at the appointed meeting place.</p>
<p>This was, in fact, laxity, but the Mongols were not trained
to strict discipline and considered the execution of a whole tribe for violating
it as a punishment incommensurate with the crime. For a whole eighteen years,
however, the frightened Mongol tribes left Chinggiskhan's horde alone.</p>
<p>It was peaceable in Ong-qan's headquarters for a certain
time, but the Naiman intrigues did their work. In 1194 his younger brother,
Erke-qara, fled and went over to the Naiman, explaining his conduct by terror
for his life. Evidently he was the leader of the pro-Naiman party, because
Inancha-qan immediately sent a force to the Kerait grazing grounds. No fighting
occurred; no one raised his spear against the invader in defence of his khan.
Ong-qan, evidently knowing the mood of the people, collected a band of faithful
men and without awaiting any benefit from the Naiman fled with them to the
Tangut in the autumn of 1196.  <a name="sik3text17"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note17">[+17]</a></p>
<p>The Tangut king dealt with the Kerait khan sympathetically.
He gave him food and sent him through Uighuria, i.e. by the only safe way, to
the Kara-Khitan. Despite nothing but mildness from the gurkhan Julqu, a year
later To`oril was obliged to flee; and it is difficult to imagine what he, being
a guest, had done. In 1197 To`oril again appeared in Tangut, but as his
companions, famished after crossing the desert, began to plunder the population,
the Tangut sent their guest on his way back into the northern steppes. He <b><font COLOR="#943634">{139}
</font></b>arrived there with only five milking goats and one
camel from which he took blood to avoid dying of hunger.</p>
<p>Then fate again smiled on the turncoat. His old friend's son
and his friend, Chinggiskhan, came to meet him, fed him and in the autumn of
1198 put him on the throne of his father and grandfather. In this way
Chinggiskhan strengthened the alliance with the Kerait because gratitude was one
of the nomad virtues, a moral categorical imperative.</p>
<p>Many of To`oril's associates, however, had a very negative
attitude to him and did not fail to express this. Through denunciation the khan
learnt of hostile speeches and ordered the conspirators to be arrested. They
were brought to him, but the khan limited himself to reproaching them with
unfaithfulness and spat in each one's face. Then he released them, but one of
those dissatisfied, a younger brother of the khan, was able to flee to the
Naiman and was welcomed there. So, two centres had been formed in the steppe:
the Mongol-Kerait and the Naiman-Merkit-Mongol one, for part of the Mongols and
Tatars were inclined to the Naiman.</p>
<p>Subsequent events are so intertwined with Mongol history
that, before dealing with them, we must glance, even if only cursorily, at that
people who seized the leadership both from the Kerait, and the Naiman and from
all the peoples of Eurasia for a whole century. We shall not plunge into a deep
sociological analysis. A very brief description of the system which had formed
among the Mongols at the end of the twelfth century is enough for our purpose.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Twelfth-Century Mongols</h4>
<p>The basic element of ancient Mongol society was the clan <i>(oboq)
</i>which was at the stage of dissolution. An aristocracy, rich and influential,
stood at the head of the numerous clans. Its representatives held honoured
titles: ba'atur (hero), noyan (lord), sechen (wise) and taishi (prince, or
member of an influential clan). The main concern of the ba'atur and noyan was to
obtain pastures and the necessary number of workers to look after the livestock
and yurts. The aristocracy ruled the lower strata of society: the retinue <i>(nokor),
</i>the clan members of lowly origin <i>(qarachu </i>or commons) and the slaves <i>(bo'ol).
</i>This last category included not so much real slaves, enslaved as prisoners
of war, as whole clans which had once been conquered by stronger clans or had
voluntarily joined them <b><font COLOR="#943634">{140} </font></b><i>(unagan-bo'ol)</i>
 <a name="sik3text18"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note18">[+18]</a>. The latter were not deprived of their personal
freedom and legally were essentially little differentiated from their lords. The
low level of productive forces and the extremely weak development of trade, even
barter, afforded no means for using compulsory labour in nomadic herding. Slaves
were used as domestic servants and this had little influence on the development
of production relations so that the basis of clan structure was preserved Joint
holding of appurtenances, sacrifices to the ancestors, blood vengeance and the
inter-tribal wars associated with it, all this was not within the competence of
the individual, but of the clan as a whole Hence, the rooted Mongol conceptions
of the clan group as the basis of social life, of clan (group) responsibility
for the fate of any member of the clan and of mutual assistance as the sole <i>leitmotiv
</i>in social conduct. A clan member always felt the support of his group and
was ever ready to fulfil the obligations the group placed on him.</p>
<p>But Mongol clans embraced the whole population of Mongolia
only ideally In fact, separate individuals were constantly to be found, those
oppressed by the discipline of the clan commune where actual power resided in
the elders, and others who, despite their services, had to be satisfied with a
second rank position. Those heroes or knights who failed to be satisfied with
always playing minor parts separated from the clan communes, left their
settlement and became &quot;people of long will&quot; or &quot;free
condition&quot; <i>(utu duru-yin gu'un), &quot;</i>white bodies&quot; <i>(baishen)
</i>in Chinese, i.e. &quot;white bone&quot;.  <a name="sik3text19"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note19">[+19]</a></p>
<p>The fate of these people was often tragic deprived of social
support, they were obliged to provide for themselves by arduous hunting in the
forests, by fishing and even by robbery, but in this case their ruin was
inevitable because there was nowhere to hide in the steppe. In course of time
they came to form separate detachments in order to resist their organised
fellow-tribesmen and to seek talented leaders to struggle with the clans and the
clan alliances. Their number continually grew and, finally, the son of a dead
tribal leader and descendant of the all-Mongol khan appeared among them after
losing his wealth and social position, a member of the famous Borjigin clan,
Temujin, who subsequently became Chinggiskhan.</p>
<p><b><font COLOR="#943634">{141}</font></b></p>
<h4>Misfortunes</h4>
<p>&nbsp;Temujin was born at the settlement of Del`iun-boldoq, eight
kilometres north of the present day Soviet-Mongolian frontier. His date of birth
is different in different sources. Rashid ad-Din writes that Chinggiskhan was
born in the &quot;year of the pig&quot;, i.e. 1152-3, but that he was 72 when he
died in August 1227, i.e. his birth would be in 1155. It seems the dating of the
<i>Yuan shi- </i>the &quot;year of the horse&quot;, 1162, is more correct, and
Mongol legendary tradition agrees with this and the calculation of the time of
Temujin's marriage and the age of his sons: Jochi, Chagatai, Ogedei and Tolui. <font FACE="Times New Roman CYR"> <a name="sik3text20"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note20">[+20]</a>
</font></p>
<p>War with the Jurchen, whom the Tatars joined after 1147,
became an urgent task for the Mongols. In 1161 the Tatars  <a name="sik3text21"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note21">[+21]</a>
defeated the Mongols at Lake Buyur; as a result of this the ancient Mongol
khanate fell apart, but the people continued the war. The grandson of Qabul-qan,
Yisugei-ba'atur, headed one of the most active Mongol tribal combinations - the
Tayichi`ut. He succeeded in stopping the Tatar offensive against the Mongols and
captured their warrior, Temujin, by whose name Yisugei called his newborn son.
Yisugei acquired an influential friend by helping the Kerait prince To`oril in
his struggle for the throne which he was waging with his uncle the gurkhan who
relied on the Naiman. However, Yisugei quarrelled with the Merkit by taking the
bride of one of their leaders, Ho`elun-eke, who became the mother of Temujin and
Qasar.</p>
<p>In accordance with clan custom, this romantic episode evoked
enmity between the Merkit and the Mongols and this subsequently became a fierce
war since, in the concept of the time, the tribe was obliged to stand up for
their humiliated fellow-tribesmen In order <b><font COLOR="#943634">{142}
</font></b>to have support in his struggle with the Tatars and
Merkit, Yisugei betrothed his nine year old son Temujin to Boite, daughter of
the leader of the powerful Mongol tribe of the Onggirat, but on the journey back
he was poisoned by Tatars, who had invited him to share their meal, and died.
Immediately after his death the tribal combination which he had headed fell
apart and his former subjects from the Tayichi`ut tribe drove all the cattle
off, leaving their leader's family in poverty. The widow and her children with
difficulty managed to live by hunting and fishing; for the Mongols the latter
indicates the lowest degree of poverty. That was how the &quot;people of long
will&quot; lived.</p>
<p>When Temujin grew up the Tayichi`ut leader, Tarqutai-kiriltuq,
making a raid on the Borjigin grazing grounds, captured Temujin and put a cangue
on him. But Temujin succeeded in escaping. After saving himself from the hands
of his fellow-tribesmen, Temujin married his intended bride, Borte, thanks to
which he gained the support of her tribe. He presented his wife's dowry, a sable
coat, to the Kerait khan who immediately recalled his former friendship with
Yisugei and promised Temujin his protection. Apart from that, Temujin swore
brotherhood with Jamuqa-sechen, the influential leader of the Jajirat tribe.
With powerful friends he no longer needed to fear the Tayichi`ut.</p>
<p>The ancient Mongols had the touching custom of sworn
brotherhood. Boys or young men exchanged gifts and became <i>anda, </i>named
brothers. Sworn brotherhood was considered superior to a blood relationship; <i>anda
</i>were like a single soul, they would never desert one another and would
always save one another from deadly danger. Aleksandr Nevskii made use of this
custom. Swearing brotherhood with Batu's son, Sartak, he became as it were the
khan's relative and, using this, he deflected many troubles from the Russian
land.</p>
<p>When Temujin was eleven (the author of the Secret History
uses the chronology of his life at the start of his story),  <a name="sik3text22"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note22">[+22]</a>
i.e. in 1172-3, he was playing with Jamuqa on the frozen Onon and they then, for
the first time, exchanged gifts; in the spring of the same year they swore to be
faithful to one another as <i>anda</i>.  <a name="sik3text23"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note23">[+23]</a></p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{143} </font></b>After this, however, they did
not meet for seven years. In these years Temujin managed to kill his
step-brother, Bekter, to be taken prisoner and escape, to marry, to make friends
with the Kerait Wankhan [Ong-qan], to acquire his own retainer and, it seems,
not only one, because some Mongol clans recognised the descendant of Qabul-qan
and Yisugei-ba`atur as their nominal head. The name of Jamuqa is not mentioned
in these events.</p>
<p>Finally, in 1180 an event took place which started a chain
reaction which resulted in the rise of the Mongol empire. In itself it was
commonplace: the Merkit made a raid on the Borjigin grazing grounds and carried
off Temujin's young wife, Borte. Temujin set off for Ong-qan to ask for help and
he advised him to turn also to Jamuqa who responded to the appeal of his <i>anda.
</i>The Kerait and Jajirat attacked the Merkit, killed many men, took the women
prisoner and freed Borte. This Trojan War in the Mongol steppe gave Temujin
enormous prestige and he quickly made use of it.</p>
<p>But then something strange takes place; for a year and a half
Temujin and Jamuqa were inseparable, but at a certain moment Jamuqa uttered a
phrase, externally signifying nothing, which put Temujin and especially Borte on
guard, and the friendship, cemented in blood, evaporated in a few minutes. This
phrase is usually called &quot;Jamuqa's nomad riddle&quot; and the causes of
subsequent events are sought in it,  <a name="sik3text24"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note24">[+24]</a>
but we shall pose the question another way <b><font COLOR="#943634">{144}
</font></b>here. How do we know about a phrase said by one friend
to another without witnesses? From the text of the Secret History. Right, but
how could the author of that source know about this phrase? Only directly from
Temujin or his wife; but that means he was someone in Temujin's camp and close
to him. If that is so, why did he, inserting a clearly incomprehensible text in
a strictly thought out story, not disclose its meaning? If this is a hint, what
about? All is so veiled that even when the words were said they were
incomprehensible to Temujin and his family who heard the phrase with its true
intonation and in a context known to them.</p>
<p>But what if we have here merely a literary device often
applied in ancient literature: inserting the author's thoughts in the hero's
mouth? But then the text conceals a political cypher which has been deliberately
served up as a riddle. We stress that the sense was unclear to those directly
involved, so who are we to uncover it? Something else is important: the friends,
without quarrelling, went their different ways and a day later many people
gathered around Temujin and proclaimed him khan. Jamuqa reacted to this
surprisingly phlegmatically, but when one of Temujin's retinue shot his younger
brother who was stealing horses, Jamuqa raided Chinggiskhan, executed his
prisoners, and returned home. Everything seemed to pass off in the manner usual
in Mongolia, because after this for eighteen years there is no news of clashes
between the <i>anda. </i>Yet during this time something did occur; because then
a civil war flared up among the Mongols such as had never happened before.
Therefore, before going further, let us comment on the events described.</p>

{145}</font></p>
<h4></b>A Historical Commentary</h4>
<p>The essence of this period that occurred from 1180 to 1183 as
regards relations between Jamuqa and Temujin consists of a transition from
separation to a rapprochement, from rapprochement to friendship, from friendship
to enmity and then to an armed clash - at least that is how it all looks
externally. Let us note another feature of this period: the start of a purposive
political struggle (not an intertribal or chance one) in Mongol history of this
time is linked with the conflict between Jamuqa and Temujin. Just with the
conflict, for all the clashes before it had an element of chance; even the
campaign against the Merkit was undertaken only to recover Borte. When Borte had
been recovered Temujin said it was enough to pursue the Merkit, he had
&quot;found what he was seeking&quot;; <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik3text25"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note25">[+25]</a></font>
they had taken matters to their conclusion - completed the campaign - by
completely plundering the Merkit; To`oril particularly, as the sources testify,
enriched himself and straightaway after the end of the campaign took himself off
and went to the river Tolu, to his Dark Wood which had been his constant
habitation.</p>
<p>Temujin and Jamuqa had been sworn brothers from childhood,
but since that distant time they had long been apart, so after the campaign
against the Merkit they felt it necessary to renew the ceremony of brotherhood.
Temujin's appeal for help to Jamuqa -through To`oril - also tells us that prior
to this time he had not maintained any relations with his <i>anda. </i>This
mutual cooling-more truly, lack of knowledge, neglect of one another - is also
felt in the sharp tone of reproach which Jamuqa used to Temujin and To`oril who
were three days late at their meeting place; and in the fact that Jamuqa,
meeting the request of his childhood friend, was most unwilling to dissipate his
forces. Instead of setting out with two of his own hosts (as To`oril proposed to
him), he recalled that &quot;on the way&quot;, &quot;upstream along the Onon
there are people who belong to the ulus of my <i>anda&quot; </i>and considered
that &quot;one host be formed from the ulus of my <i>anda. </i>Another host from
here will be two hosts in all&quot; <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik3text26"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note26">[+26]</a> </font>-
and he sets forth with these two hosts, of which only one is his. Such is the
starting point for the second period in the relationship between Temujin and
Jamuqa. We do not know what moves Jamuqa in his behaviour, we do not know his
plans, his true views <b><font COLOR="#943634">{146} </font></b>on
what took place There is no need to judge his relation to Temujin over the
campaign against the Merkit, essentially they still did not know one another
After the campaign something took place which was in all probability
uncharacteristic of such combined campaigns instead of each leaving for his own
ulus and there living his former life, as this had normally been done, for
example, it seems To'onl, Jamuqa and Temujin again perform the ritual of sworn
brotherhood, remain together and pass inseparably &quot;in complete peace and
agreement one year and half another&quot;  <a name="sik3text27"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note27">[+27]</a>.</p>
<p>What guided Temujin's and Jamuqa's conduct? Perhaps
friendship? But Jamuqa's sincerity (and Temujin's, of course) is open to doubt,
this friendship is very similar to strengthening that alliance they had formed
on the campaign, a military and political alliance.</p>
<p>We do not know what prompted Temujin and Jamuqa to conclude
an alliance so unusual for the time Perhaps it really was only a friendly
affection which had suddenly burst forth. But even in this case, objectively,
independently of the two of them, it was a fact of social significance. The
enormous political repercussions which the break between Temujin and Jamuqa
caused, bringing the entire country into motion, shows that.</p>
<p>The break between the sworn brothers was unexpected The
attempt to explain its causes on the basis of the Concealed Tale has had no
specific results Yet this moment is extremely important in understanding two key
problems in the history of both Middle Asia and also of the whole world (1) how
and why was the Mongol Empire formed, and (2) why did its nomad neighbours lose
their war with it the Naiman and Kerait, Merkit and Tatars As we shall see
below, Jamuqa's part here was no less than that of Temujin Yet twentieth-century
historians do not pose the questions for what reason7 and why7 - although
history becomes a science only if these questions are answered In his very
detailed and conscientious work,  <a name="sik3text28"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note28">[+28]</a>
R Grousset limited himself to repeating what the source says, but there is no
answer to our question there We have to look for ourselves Let us turn to the
facts.</p>
<p>In the same year, 1182, Jamuqa, after learning of Temujin
being made Chinggiskhan, turned to the distinguished Mongols, Altan and Quchar,
seeing them as the chief culprits of the break &quot;Why <b><font COLOR="#943634">{147}
</font></b>have you, Altan and Quchar, parted me and my <i>anda, </i>interfering
in our affairs?&quot;  <a name="sik3text29"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note29">[+29]</a>
This question by Jamuqa and the challenge he made, not to Chinggis, but
precisely to those two can be interpreted in different ways We can suppose that
Jamuqa has not yet decided to challenge Chinggis openly himself, but one can
also see in this simply an insult to those who by their intrigues had led to a
break between the <i>anda</p>
</i>
<p>Mention of Altan and Quchar chimes in with other information
on the Concealed Tale which states that Temujm was joined by &quot;Quchar-beki,
son of Nekun-taishi, as one kuren, by Altan-otchigin, son of Qutula-qan as one
kuren&quot;.  <a name="sik3text30"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note30">[+30]</a>
That these people came &quot;with one kuren&quot; is their main feature, as it
were opposed to a possible greater number of them If we turn our attention to
the fact that they were the sons of khans, the sense of the description becomes
clear, it amounts to stressing that they had separated from their tribes This
circumstance would be of little import, were it not that a thread leads from it
to an answer to the question why should Altan and Quchar &quot;separate&quot;
Temujin and Jamuqa?</p>
<p>On the morning after the night when the incident between the
sworn brothers occurred, according to the author of the Concealed Tale, many
people approached Temujin In relating this, the author describes them as he does
Altan and Quchar. This would be an astonishing coincidence, were there no deeper
meaning concealed in it. This is what the author says &quot;the following tribes
came three Toqura`un brothers from the Jalair From the Barulas tribe From the
Mangqut tribe&quot; etc. That is, here, too, there were not tribes, but parts of
them, and those coming from one tribe were connected by family ties - fathers
and sons, brothers Tribal fragmentation does not have to be queried, it is
obvious and literally demonstrated by the source, for example &quot;Ogolen-cherbi,
his younger brother, separated himself from the Arulat tribe and came to his
brother Bo`orchu. From the Uriangqai tribe separated out and came&quot;  <a name="sik3text31"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note31">[+31]</a>
and so on They came to Temujin not in tribes, but in families or kuren -
military units, as simple warriors and as aristocrats.</p>
<p>Then, two mutually exclusive programmes were put forward The
clan elders wanted to create a confederation of tribes with an <b><font COLOR="#943634">{148}
</font></b>elected khan. For this post Jamuqa was the most
suitable candidate, an experienced warrior and a shrewd politician. With the
victory of this programme the &quot;people of long will&quot; would have no
place left in the scheme of things. Therefore, they grouped themselves around
Temujin who was, essentially, one of them. As soon as Temujin, who had prepared
for the turnabout, moved away from Jamuqa a retinue of 13,000 warriors formed
around him. In 1182 they chose Temujin as khan under the name Chinggis, taking
an oath to him with a very characteristic text: &quot;When Temujin becomes khan,
we, the leading detachment pursuing the enemy, will deliver to him beautiful
maidens and wives, yurts, slaves and the best horses. In the battue we will
allot you half the prey. If in days of war we violate your rule, scatter our
black heads over the earth; if in peace time we violate your tranquillity,
separate us from our wives, children and slaves, cast us into the lordless
land.&quot;  <a name="sik3text32"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note32">[+32]</a> Here
are agreed the division of the spoils and the punishment for the violation of
discipline: in time of war, execution, in peacetime, exile. The conditions are
typical for an emergent military organisation.</p>
<p>The choice of Temujin as khan was recognised by the Kerait,
but met opposition among the Mongols themselves, the majority of whom did not
join Temujin but united around Jamuqa. The gathering conflict took place as a
result of the killing of Jamuqa's brother who was intending to drive off a herd
from Chinggis's people. Jamuqa brought 30,000 horsemen who had voluntarily
joined him, but Chinggiskhan had only 13,000 men from various clans and tribes. <a name="sik3text33"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note33">[+33]</a>
At a battle at Dalan-baljut Jamuqa overcame Chinggis's force and bottled him up
in a defile near the Onon.  <a name="sik3text34"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note34">[+34]</a>
But, true to the traditions of inter-tribal wars, he restricted himself to
executing the prisoners and led off his forces, thanks to which Chinggiskhan was
saved, had a breathing space of 18 years and grew so strong that war became
unavoidable.</p>
<p>Here a question arises: for whom? It seems, for all! For the
Mongols opposed to Chinggiskhan, for his horde had filled out with <b><font COLOR="#943634">{149}
</font></b>people of long will&quot; who had personal scores to
settle with relatives who had insulted them, so these rich relatives had every
ground for disquiet. For the surrounding tribes: the Tatars who had poisoned
Chinggiskhan's father, and the Merkit who had dishonoured his wife. For Ong-qan
the Kerait, trying to increase his prestige by victories. For the Naiman khan
who somewhat later formulated his evaluation of the political situation as
follows: &quot;There are not two suns in heaven; can a people have two
rulers?&quot;  <a name="sik3text35"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note35">[+35]</a>
This notable phrase shows that even at the start of the thirteenth century the
traditions of steppe unity that had been founded by the Hun, developed by the
Turks and continued by that combination of Mongol-speaking Tatar tribes which
are notionally called the Zubu, had not disappeared. Now the time had come to
crown the edifice of nomad culture and only one thing was unclear: would the
Naiman or the Mongols do this.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{150}</font></p>
<h4></b>An Attempt at an Analysis</h4>
<p>Jamuqa appears on the pages of the Concealed Tale again with
the choice of Temujin as Chinggiskhan and the battle at Dalan-bahut, in the
account of which there is the following phrase &quot;The Jadaran, headed by
Jamuqa, united around themselves thirteen tribes and formed a force of three
hosts with Chinggiskhan there were also thirteen kuren and he also formed a
force of three hosts and went to meet Jamuqa&quot;  <a name="sik3text36"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note36">[+36]</a>
From this we conclude that each of the opponents had a force of three hosts, but
that Jamuqa had 13 tribes, while Chinggis had 13 kuren. The difference is
enormous a kuren is not a synonym for a tribe in this context - it is a military
unit (although it might happen that a tribe might field one kuren).  <a name="sik3text37"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note37">[+37]</a>
The description in the Concealed Tale of the election of Jamuqa as a gurkhan,
which was separated from the moment dealt with (1182) by a period of eighteen
years (1200), allows us to reach a definitive conclusion It is the
&quot;tribes&quot; who elect Jamuqa, i.e. the tribal aristocracy which guides
this alliance against Chinggiskhan (&quot;they agreed to undertake a campaign
against Chinggiskhan and Ong-qan&quot;).  <a name="sik3text38"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note38">[+38]</a></p>
<p>All that has been adduced above leads to the following
conclusions in this period the Mongol tribe experienced a period of decline, the
features of this process are an extreme exacerbation of relations between the
tribal aristocracy and those who were not submissive and were striving to escape
from the orbit of the tribe. The process proceeded so far that it posed the
renegades who had separated from the tribe - the &quot;people of long will&quot;
- the task of uniting based, naturally, on a principle other than the tribal
one, in circumstances where relations between the &quot;people of long
will&quot; and the tribal top men were exacerbated, this principle could only be
the military one. All this found practical expression in the unification of
kurens around Temujin and the &quot;tribes&quot; around Jamuqa.</p>
<p>Let us return once more to one of the circumstances in the
break between Temujin and Jamuqa the &quot;people of long will&quot;, all those
&quot;from the tribe&quot; of so-and-so, approached Temujin simultaneously and
immediately after his departure from Jamuqa. This fact alone, that they came to
Temujin at one and the same time, that means <b><font COLOR="#943634">{151}
</font></b>together, makes us think that they had been together
before this and were not far from Temujin, as is shown by their instantaneous
reaction to the news of the friends&quot; quarrel. Their being at the ready,
their expectation of a break is perhaps explained only by their link with
Temujin. Here especially the part played by Altan and Quchar in all this story
becomes understandable, the part of intermediaries between Temujin and the
&quot;people of long will&quot;, to whom they themselves were related, since
they too were &quot;from the tribe...&quot; Jamuqa's reproach was well founded.</p>
<p>The battle at Dalan-baljut crowns this period; an account of
it is found in the Concealed Tale and in Rashid ad-Din, but the latter's account
is completely opposed to that of the former. The Concealed Tale asserts that
Jamuqa was victorious, he bottled up &quot;Chinggis in the defile, executed the
princelings of the Chinos clan and left&quot;. Rashid ad-Din has it all the
other way round: Chinggiskhan was victorious and he executed his enemies in the
same way. Whom are we to believe? Him who was not concerned to distort the
events, the author of the Concealed Tale, because the humiliation of
Chinggiskhan before his enemies was not part of his task. Moreover, he is not
particularly sympathetic to Jamuqa: he is depicted in both positive and negative
actions. On the contrary, Rashid ad-Din was directly concerned to distort
reality. His task of extolling Chinggiskhan prevented him from showing his hero
in the humiliated position of the vanquished. Therefore, in Rashid ad-Din
details of the battle are lacking, but there are many general phases, such as:
&quot;Chinggiskhan's enemies were scattered by the sun of his good fortune, like
motes in airy space&quot;.  <a name="sik3text39"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note39">[+39]</a></p>
<p>In the description of the battle at Dalan-baljut we encounter
for the first time a link in the chain of paradoxes in Jamuqa's conduct: at the
threshold of victory over Chinggiskhan he suddenly rejects it and leaves the
site of the battle, merely saying: &quot;Well, we have firmly bottled him up in
the Jerene gorge of the Onon!&quot;  <a name="sik3text40"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note40">[+40]</a>
Why did he do this?</p>
<p>Now that we know what antagonistic social forces were
represented by Jamuqa and Temujin we can try to approach the problem of to what
degree each of their personal interests coincided with those of the side they
headed. This can be done by deducting what <b><font COLOR="#943634">{152}
</font></b>is motivated by social interests, the interests of the
two warring camps into which society had split; the remainder describes the
person.</p>
<p>The Concealed Tale describes the first clash between Jamuqa
and Chinggiskhan as follows: learning of the killing of his younger brother by
one of Chinggiskhan's followers, Jamuqa sets out with a force against his sworn
brother from whom Altan and Quchar had &quot;separated&quot; him. Learning of
Jamuqa's advance, Chinggiskhan also collects a force and goes to meet him; a
battle takes place at Dalan-baljut; then Jamuqa drives Chinggiskhan and his
force into the defile. If Jamuqa, forgetting his former friendship with Temujin,
goes against him with a force, and that means he wants to defeat him, it is
completely incomprehensible why, on the eve of victory, when he has to take a
single step to destroy his enemy, he fails to take this step, but turns back.
The impression is given that it is not a single man, but two different ones who
are acting here - one gives the order for the start of military operations, the
other the order to leave the battlefield. The thought involuntarily arises that
two wills were involved in this battle and in everything to do with it, but so
contradictory that the action of one destroys the commitment of the other. But
in the light of our twofold understanding of the chain of events we are looking
at - on the personal and the social planes - it becomes clear what two wills
could operate here.</p>
<p>The coming together of the &quot;people of long will&quot;,
their choice of Temujin as khan - and as a reaction, evidently, a similar
unification of thirteen tribes around Jamuqa - raised the temperature to white
heat, so that the killing of Jamuqa's brother caused the start of military
action. It is not precisely known what aims Jamuqa himself had when he set out,
but what the coalition of &quot;tribes&quot; in this campaign wanted is not open
to doubt. In circumstances where the warring sides had only just become
organised on a country-wide scale, when the enemy forces were still unknown, the
party most aggressive and spoiling for a fight should be the one whose
traditional dominance is being encroached on by the mere existence of the other.
So, those around Jamuqa were greatly concerned with the campaign, but they were
concerned with it only as a means. The aim was to destroy the coalition of
Chinggis's followers, which, as we have seen, did not take place, and that is
why the order to retreat describes Jamuqa and him alone.</p>
<p>If we look at Jamuqa's conduct in all this history of the
campaign <b><font COLOR="#943634">{153} </font></b>starting
from the fact that, setting out with the tribal aristocracy against Chinggiskhan,
he was also with them in his concerns, i.e. pursued the aim of completely
routing and destroying Chinggis, then we inevitably find ourselves in a dead end
in trying to explain Jamuqa's order to leave Dalan-baljut. On the other hand,
however, we cannot say that he was not interested in the campaign. Just as no
one stopped him breaking off the campaign a single step from victory, so no one
could have compelled him to take part in it had he not wanted to. Therefore, <i>it
</i>is difficult to say what moved Jamuqa, but it is clear that his concerns
were not those of those around him, they coincided only in their general
direction - Chinggis, but no more. Apart from that, the tribal aristocracy's
aims should have been achieved by a victorious completion of the campaign, while
Jamuqa's aims were achieved by the campaign itself, so Jamuqa did not consider
it necessary to carry it to its conclusion.</p>
<p>The departure of the Uru'ut and Mangqut from Jamuqa to
Chinggis after the battle is a fact closely connected with what has been said;
it was their reaction to Jamuqa's decision to leave Dalan-baljut. Had their
going over to Chinggis been dictated by no other factor than sympathy for him,
they should have transferred to him before the battle and this could only have
benefited him; no one would have been able to hinder them from doing this before
the battle, any more than afterwards, i.e. the cause of their departure resides
in the battle itself, not elsewhere. Since they took part in the campaign,
pursuing the same aims as all the tribal aristocracy, the cause of their
departure, naturally, lay not in the fact of the battle itself, but in the
unexpected factor that showed itself in it - in the lack of coincidence, more
than that, in the contradiction between Jamuqa's concerns and those of his
allies and Jamuqa's flouting of the tribal aristocracy's concerns.</p>
<p>In other words, we see one of those rare cases in history
when the concerns of the head of a social grouping are not identical with its
aspirations and if they do come into contact, it is only temporarily. Then an
illusion of unanimity arises which is destroyed as soon as a moment comes when
the matter requires true unanimity, and the actions of such a social grouping
are foredoomed to failure. The Uru'ut and Mangqut understood this, this and this
alone could be the cause of their seemingly inexplicable departure to Chinggis.
In fact, their transfer from Jamuqa to Chinggis was not simply from one leader
to another. This was a transfer from one warring camp to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{154}
</font></b>another. Social contradictions between the tribal
aristocracy, in whose camp the Uru'ut and Mangqut were, and the &quot;people of
long will&quot; lay at the base of this enmity.</p>
<p>How can the transfer of &quot;tribes&quot; to the side of
Chinggis be explained? Only in one way, by the content of the developing
political struggle. But here we have to take account of the following. While the
camp of the &quot;people of long will&quot; was homogeneous in its composition
and its aspirations, the aristocratic camp was divided into two strata: the
tribal aristocracy who were in conflict with the &quot;people of long
will&quot;, and the ordinary members of the tribes who were potentially those
same &quot;people of long will&quot; and were only distinguished from them by
their obedience to the tribal aristocracy. Such a situation created instability
in the camp of the tribal aristocracy and the possible transfer of tribes to
Chinggiskhan's camp if their leaders were interested in such a transfer.</p>
<p>What political calculation is concealed in the action of the
Uru'ut and the Mangqut? Why did the leaders of these tribes, despite the fact
that the &quot;people of long will&quot; belonged to their social opponents,
nevertheless join their future fate to theirs? Probably, simply because the
social marker had ceased to function as it had when people were being divided
into two warring camps. The promotion of a military aristocracy in the camp of
the &quot;people of long will&quot; transformed the struggle of the latter from
one for freedom and independence into one for domination. Therefore, the victory
of the &quot;people of long will&quot; in fact signified the establishment of
dominance by a military aristocracy headed by Chinggis. It was possible to serve
this upper group, so the Uru'ut and Mangqut in fact did not go over to the side
of the &quot;people of long will&quot;, but went to serve Chinggis and his
associates. But all the same, what drove them to such a transfer? The fact that,
being the most warlike (which Jamuqa himself later noted), they, of course,
strove to conquer. Jamuqa did not justify their expectations, it became clear to
them that it was impossible to conquer with him and they went over to Chinggis,
thanks to which he was transformed from a leader of a band to a sovereign.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Temujin and Jamuqa</h4>
<p>Constant internal wars, raids, mutual cattle stealing and
other &quot;delights&quot; afflicted the Mongols themselves. When to this was
added an external threat, the demand for unification began to be felt by the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{155}
</font></b>whole people. The Tatars, egged on by the Jurchen,
pressed them from the south. The Merkit threatened them from the north, trying
to pay back their recent defeat. In the west the Naiman became active and had
again succeeded in finding a claimant to the throne of the Kerait khanate, in
driving out Ong-qan temporarily and thus weakening the only Mongol ally. The
Mongols were surrounded. But it was impossible to effect their unification
without a programme acceptable to the overwhelming majority of the people. This
did not exist.</p>
<p>To Chinggiskhan's good fortune, the intelligent and
farsighted Inancha-qan played no part in the last five years of his life. Either
he was ill, or his age told on him, or perhaps his children kept him back, being
less talented and shrewd than he was. When Inancha-qan died in 1201 and his
khanate was divided into two khanates which, although not openly warring, dealt
with one another more than coldly, a fierce tribal war developed.</p>
<p>In 1201 sixteen tribal leaders  <a name="sik3text41"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note41">[+41]</a>
assembled for a kuriltai and chose Jamuqa as gurkhan, setting war against
Chinggiskhan and Ong-qan as their aim. The younger brother of Buyiruq-qan was
the Naiman representative. In a battle at Koyiten Chinggiskhan and Ong-qan
routed this assemblage thanks to the fact that a hurricane suddenly arose and
the various tribes of Jamuqa's force lost contact with one <b><font COLOR="#943634">{156}
</font></b>another. &quot;And Jamuqa, after plundering the people
who had made him into a khan&quot;  <a name="sik3text42"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note42">[+42]</a>
retreated and left his allies. Building on his success, Chinggiskhan routed the
Tayichi`ut on the banks of the Onon and in the following year (1202) inflicted a
decisive defeat on the Tatars. At this time Ong-qan undertook a campaign against
the Merkit and drove them west from Baikal, gaining a fair amount of booty,
moreover. Then the allies again united and attacked the Naiman Buyiruq-qan. He
fled, without giving battle, but was caught on the lower reaches of the Urunggu
and killed.  <a name="sik3text43"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note43">[+43]</a></p>
<p>Then the main forces of the Naiman entered the war. At the
site of Bayidaraq-belchir the commander Kokse`u-sabraq barred the way to the
Kerait and Mongols who were leaving after their raid. In the night Ong-qan
separated himself from Chinggis, for some reason joined with Jamuqa and left;
Chinggis, seeing that he was alone, also retreated, but to the other side. The
Naiman set off in pursuit of Ong-qan and took many prisoners. Then Chinggis sent
a force to rescue Ong-qan and helped him recover the prisoners. Ong-qan adopted
Chinggis for this.  <a name="sik3text44"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note44">[+44]</a></p>
<p>It would seem that the alliance should have been
strengthened, but instead the Kerait grandees and the prince Nilqa-Senggum
conspired against Chinggis. They wanted to entice him to them and kill him. For
some reason, in Ong-qan's headquarters the first adviser was Jamuqa who had
caused the conflict, but refused to take part in the war.  <a name="sik3text45"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note45">[+45]</a>
The Kerait prepared a raid on the Mongols, wanting to take them by surprise, but
some simple herdsmen  <a name="sik3text46"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note46">[+46]</a>
who changed <b><font COLOR="#943634">{157} </font></b>sides,
hoping for a reward for timely information, warned Chinggis-khan and the Mongol
women and children were able to get away, while the force prepared for battle.
In the battle at Qala`un-a`ula the Mongols managed to avoid complete defeat
thanks to the insane bravery of the Uru'ut leader, Quyuldar, who flung his troop
at the centre of the Kerait army and thus wrecked their attack. Under cover of
night Chinggiskhan led the remnants of his force away, 2,600 horsemen in all.
The Mongols, skilfully manoeuvring, avoided a repeat battle, lulled Kerait
vigilance by negotiations and in a surprise attack by Jeje`er mountain (between
the sources of the Tola and the Kerulen) routed them in a night battle in the
autumn of 1203. Ong-qan fled to the Naiman and was killed in an encounter with a
Naiman frontier guard, because the officer of the guard did not know his face
and did not believe that he could be such an important person.
 <a name="sik3text47"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note47">[+47]</a> The remnants of the Kerait, under the protection of
his son, Senggum, fled and reached Khotan where the leader of the Kalach tribe
seized and killed Senggum.  <a name="sik3text48"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note48">[+48]</a></p>
<p>Thus ended the most powerful and ancient Christian khanate of
Central Asia, falling as a sacrifice to the pagans; but it is curious that this
side of the matter is not reflected in all the sources. Rashid ad-Din notes
merely in his introductory description: &quot;The call of Jesus - peace be to
him! - had reached them and they entered into his faith&quot;,  <a name="sik3text49"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note49">[+49]</a>
without drawing any conclusion from it. In the Concealed Tale only the Kerait
prayer &quot;Abai-Babai&quot;, i.e. &quot;Our Father&quot; is mentioned, and
that incidentally.  <a name="sik3text50"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note50">[+50]</a>
The only deduction is that the Mongols themselves did not attach importance to
the difference in faith.  <a name="sik3text51"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note51">[+51]</a></p>
<p>And from this point of view it is very important that the
Kerait themselves held the same opinion. An extremely distorted version of the
fall of their kingdom is preserved in Siberian chronicles. It is so distorted
that no researcher has taken it into his head to relate this entry to the events
of the thirteenth century. Here is the text.  <a name="sik3text52"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note52">[+52]</a><font COLOR="#ff0000">
</font><b><font COLOR="#943634">{158} </font></b>&quot;There
was a king of Mahomet's law by name On&quot; (thus in the Esipov chronicle),
Ivan (in the Stroganov) or On-Som-khan (in the Remizov chronicle). Against him
&quot;there rose up one from his power from the simple people by name Chingi and
he went against him like a brigand... and killed On, and Chingi himself [entered
into] the kingship.&quot;</p>
<p>Here much is confused. Islam is put in place of the forgotten
Nestorianism; Chinggiskhan is called a simple brigand, but what is important for
us is that information passing through dozens of hands has kept its sense - a
social one. The leader of the &quot;people of long will&quot; would appear to
his opponents as a brigand leader of a band. The source has not lost this basic
content. But, in order to find the pearl of truth in the accumulated layers of
its shell, we should learn the factual history properly, for only in this way
can the researcher's system of association be expanded to the limits needed.</p>
<p>Yet if the Kerait and Mongols had common traditions formed
when they both were part of a general nomadic unity, notionally called Zubu, the
Naiman were quite another people, and war between them and the Mongols should be
regarded as an external, intertribal one. Our sources unanimously assert that
the initiative for the war belonged to the Naiman Tayang-qan who attempted to
attract the Ongut into an alliance, but they refused point-blank and warned
Chinggiskhan. On the other side, all those who survived the victories of
Chinggis and the carnage that followed them: Tatars, Merkit, Mongols, adherents
of Jamuqa and others, gathered round the Naiman khan in order to continue the
struggle. In 1204 both forces clashed near the Hangai mountains, at a decisive
moment Jamuqa led his detachment away and the Naiman suffered defeat. Tayang-qan
perished, his mother was captured and his son, Kuchlug, fled to the Merkit who
had succeeded in retreating along the Irtysh valley beyond the Altai. The steppe
had again been united as under the Turkish and Uighur khans.</p>
<p>Chinggiskhan's last remaining unconquered opponent was his
sworn brother and first competitor, Jamuqa-sechen. In 1205 he was seized by his
own warriors, handed over to Chinggis and executed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Great Kuriltai</h4>
<p>All the forces defending the &quot;nine-footed white
banner&quot; in battles with their fellow tribesmen gathered on the banks of the
Onon in <b><font COLOR="#943634">{159} </font></b>1206.
This assembly, the kuriltai, was the highest organ of power and it alone had the
right to entrust rule to a particular person who was thereafter called khan.
They would raise him on a felt above the heads of the surrounding crowd who
expressed their willingness to obey him by their cries. Of course, Temujin was
for the second time chosen as khan and the kuriltai confirmed his title of
Chinggiskhan. They were also called on to determine the name of the people whose
core were the faithful adherents of Chinggiskhan along with their families and
domestic slaves. Then they were called Mongols and this name was officially
attached to the newly formed people and military force.</p>
<p>The most noteworthy circumstance here was that the Mongol
force had grown from 13,000 volunteers to a regular army of 110,000. It is clear
that the increase took place by including conquered Kerait and Naiman in the
forces. But people are not chessmen. Being included in the conqueror's army they
never once displayed disloyalty to the new khan, and this means that acceptable
conditions had been created for them. To every Mongol veteran there were now ten
new war prisoners accustomed to rebel even against their own tribal khans. In
this army strength was on the side of the conquered, but they rapidly became
faithful subjects. It seems that here a decisive part was played by the steppe
tradition of a strong central power able to withstand sedentary neighbours:
Jurchen, Tangut and Muslim. Changing the nickname Zubu for the proud name of
Mongol, they lost nothing; and those who did not want to live in the united
state went to the west and continued the war. These were the untamed Merkit and
part of the Naiman. The rest transferred their sympathies to Chinggiskhan.</p>
<p>The clan principle was quickly and consciously broken.
Commanders were rewarded according to their services and not by birthright.
Warriors were allocated to the units of ten, a hundred or a thousand and were
obliged to serve from the age of fourteen to seventy. To maintain order, apart
from the army of 100,000, a guard of 10,000 was formed which had the duty of
guarding the khan's yurt. The military statute of Chinggis's army was taken as
the basis for the laws. Two punishments were established: the death penalty and
banishment to Siberia. A distinguishing feature of this enactment was the
introduction of a penalty for failing to help a fellow soldier in trouble. This
law was called the <i>Yasa </i>and Chinggis's second son, Chagatai, was
appointed guardian of the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{160} </font></b>Yasa
(supreme procurator). The new born empire arose as a result of wars and only for
wars, for which there still remained not a few grounds.</p>
<p>In such a warlike assemblage of people from various tribes it
was essential to maintain strict order and real force was always needed for
this. Chinggiskhan foresaw this and created two watches, a day and a night one,
from his most trusted warriors. They were on duty in the horde throughout the
twenty-four hours, were inseparable from the khan and obeyed him alone. This was
the Mongol apparatus of compulsion, set above the army officers: an ordinary
guardsman counted as superior to an officer of a thousand.  <a name="sik3text53"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note53">[+53]</a>
Ninety-five noyans were appointed by the officers of a thousand and these &quot;laboured
... in creating the state&quot;.  <a name="sik3text54"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note54">[+54]</a>
Thus, from the &quot;people of long will&quot; a military elite was created
which cannot be called either an aristocracy, or an oligarchy, or a democracy,
for this was the horde of the ancient Turkish kaganate,  <a name="sik3text55"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note55">[+55]</a>
but grown to embrace the whole Great Steppe and swallowing up the tribes.</p>
<p>The horde is the people and the troops. To count the officers
of military units as aristocrats is wrong, if only because they receive posts as
a reward for services, and can be demoted for faults. The clan of all Mongols
was equally ancient, from Alan-goa. You cannot call this system democracy
either, since the masses were bound by an iron military discipline. And what
sort of an oligarchy is it, when the superior power belongs to the khan? But it
is extremely doubtful whether this is a monarchy, because the khan is only a
president for life, chosen by all the troops -whose mood he has to consider.
This system cannot be called a tyranny, because legal power - the Yasa - was
separated from the khan's executive power. According to the accepted system, the
khan had the right to demand observance of the law, but not its violation.
Later, when Ozbeg in 1312 proposed to his subjects that they should accept
Islam, they replied: &quot;You expect from us submissiveness and obedience, but
as for our faith and creed, what affair is it of yours, and how shall we desert
the law and Yasa of Chinggiskhan and go over to the faith of the Arabs?&quot;  <a name="sik3text56"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note56">[+56]</a></p>
<p>As we see, the power of the khan was much more restricted
than that of the kings of feudal Europe. There was no gentry, but all were
serfs.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{161} </font></b>Of course, the Mongol
veterans received the best positions and posts for their services. It might seem
this was enough to see in them the start of a future feudal estate. That was not
it! As we shall see below, they did not manage to savour the fruits of their
victories and bequeath their position and wealth to their children. Each war,
even a victorious one, reduced their number and increased the number of the
subjugated who were incorporated into the forces and thus became members of the
horde with full rights. The percentage relationship changed to the disadvantage
of the victors.</p>
<p>The economy of the unified Mongolia also posed a very complex
problem. A six-year civil war could not but be reflected in the sole form of the
people's wealth, the number of livestock. During campaigns livestock were eaten,
rather than pastured. Consequently, in order to feed the army, which could not
be dismissed because there were enemies on all the frontiers, they had to
continue the war. Then the troops, passing the frontier, found themselves food,
while at home the children and dogs protected the lambs against the wolves. Yet
such a solution meant that the people must be under constant tension, without
the slightest hope of rest. And the government, if it wanted to survive, was
obliged to ensure the loyalty of the majority of the population bearing bows and
sabres.</p>
<p>No single government can survive without money, and, as we
have seen, nothing could be collected from the people and troops; on the
contrary, payments had to be made to them, if only for food and equipment. The
Mongol khan received these means in taxes on the caravans; this drew Mongolia
into a complex international policy which demanded a strong, individual
authority.</p>
<p>But how did Chinggiskhan manage to reconcile his new
subjects, accustomed to a free life, to his unlimited power? And are we not
contradicting our own earlier conclusions on the part played by confession of
faith in replacing confessional by political primacy? That's the point; we are
not! Chinggis married his sons to Christian women: Ogedei to the Merkit Toregena,
Tolui to the Kerait princess Sorqoqtani-Beki. Nestorian churches were erected in
the khan's headquarters and Chinggis's grandchildren were brought up to respect
the Christian faith.</p>
<p>The Mongol &quot;black faith&quot;  <a name="sik3text57"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note57">[+57]</a>
whose adherents and officials had <b><font COLOR="#943634">{162}
</font></b>been Chinggis's support in the difficult years was,
though not abolished, exceedingly restricted in its opportunities. The head of
the Mongol church, the soothsayer Kokochii, was in the habit of trying to
influence state affairs and to gather people, attracting them even from among
the princes. Well, he was invited to the khan's headquarters and there they
broke his back, after which his adherents &quot;became quiet&quot;.  <a name="sik3text58"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note58">[+58]</a></p>
<p>Limitation of the &quot;black faith&quot;, of course, did not
mean that Nestorianism became or even had the chance to become the state
religion. On the other hand, the Nestorians had access to state posts and,
consequently, the possibility of directing the policy of the newly born empire.
That is why the Naiman prince Kuchlug and the Merkit prince Toqto`a-beki found
themselves isolated and went off beyond the Altai where the Kipchak accepted and
supported them. These brave men did not give up their sabres.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Fame and Ruin</h4>
<p>War was renewed in 1207. Chinggis's eldest son, Jochi, in a
single campaign conquered the &quot;forest peoples&quot; of Southern Siberia
without meeting serious opposition and this ensured the rear of the Mongol ulus.
In the following year, 1208, the Mongol commander Sube-'etei reached the Naiman
and Merkit and compelled them to give battle in the Irtysh valley by the
confluence of the Bukhtarma. Tokto'a, the Merkit leader, fell in the battle, his
children fled to the Kipchak (to present day Kazakhstan), while the Naiman
prince Kuchlug and his fellow tribesmen left for the Seven Streams area and were
there kindly received by the gurkhan Julqu who needed warriors for his war with
the Khwarizmshah Muhammed. Subsequently, Kuchlug became a close friend and
favourite of the gurkhan who was not distinguished by his foresight and ability
to judge character. The gurkhan even gave him his daughter</p>
<p>1209 brought the gurkhan great grief. We have noted that the
small Kara-Khitai state was financed by Uighur merchants who had asked the khan
to deal with their Muslim competitors. As the gurkhan did not cope with his
allotted task the Uighurs killed the Khitan official and offered their
allegiance to Chinggiskhan. This was a deal advantageous to both sides. The
Mongol khan was faced <b><font COLOR="#943634">{163} </font></b>with
war with the Jurchen. The whole of steppe opinion demanded this of him. But
money is needed for any war. The Uighurs gave the money.</p>
<p>The Uighur merchants needed goods for trade. They were able
to buy up from the Mongol warriors any amount of booty, on the cheap, of course,
since they were the monopolists; moreover, the Mongols needed literate
officials. It had reached the point where vacancies were offered to Naiman
prisoners. The literate Uighur soon offered their services and received posts
which were no less profitable than even their trade deals. There were no further
reasons to delay war with the Jin Empire and in 1211 it started.</p>
<p>The Mongols directed the first blow at the Tangut kingdom.
This was, rather, a military and political move. In 1209 the Mongols routed the
Tangut field forces, collected an enormous number of cattle and camels, but were
compelled to abandon the siege of the capital since the Tangut broke the dams
and flooded the surroundings of the town with the waters of the Huang He. The
Mongols withdrew after concluding a peace and a treaty of mutual military aid
which freed their troops for the main campaign.</p>
<p>The moment for the start of the inevitable war had been
selected extremely carefully. The Jin Empire was already engaged in war on three
fronts: with the Song empire, the Tangut and the popular movement of the
&quot;Red Robes&quot; who were struggling against foreign authority. Despite the
numerical preponderance of their opponents, the Jurchen were victorious
everywhere. In the spring of 1211 the Mongols took the frontier fortress of Wu-sha.
Soon, several fortresses fell which the Jurchen had relied on as an
insurmountable bulwark against the nomads and the whole country to the gates of
Beijing had been devastated. The Khitan troops rose and went over to the
Mongols, justifying this by claiming they were blood brothers. In 1215 Beijing
fell and Chinggiskhan concluded an armistice since he was summoned by urgent
matters in the west.</p>
<p>The Merkit who in 1208 had withdrawn beyond the mountain
passes of the Altai and the Tarbagatai had had help from the Kipchak or eastern
Polovtsy. Thanks to this, by 1216 they had gathered their strength and attempted
to strike the Mongols in their rear. Only two tumen [10,000 men form a tumen -
trans.] of select Mongol troops hurriedly flung forward from Central Mongolia
under the command of the eldest royal prince, Jochi, halted and repulsed the
enemy. The Merkit, deserted by Kuchlug, were <b><font COLOR="#943634">{164}
</font></b>compelled to accept a battle and lost it The remains
of the routed Merkit troops fled to the west, but the Mongols caught up with
them by the Irgiz and they were cut down to the last man There, too, by the
Irgiz, the Mongols were subjected to an attack by the Khwarizmshah Muhammed who
liked to fight the infidel Surprised by a sudden attack for no reason, the
Mongols pressed the Khwarizm forces hard and returned home</p>
<p>In the Kara-Khitan kingdom matters went from bad to worse The
gurkhan's advances to the Khwarizmshah Muhammed merely led to the strengthening
of Khwarizm By 1208 Muhammed refused to pay tribute, attracted the ruler of
Khotan to his side and occupied Bukhara and Samarkand The Muslim population,
tormented by the wilfulness of the Kara-Khitan grandees and tax collectors,
welcomed the Khwarizm men as liberators That was where the troops collected by
Kuchlug among Chinggiskhan's former enemies were needed, but Kuchlug embarked on
an adventurist course instead of helping his father-in-law, he seized the
gurkhan's treasury in Uzgend and, learning that the greater part of the Kara-Khitan
troops were fighting the Muslim, tried to seize the person of the gurkhan
himself This boldness failed the gurkhan was able to collect a force and defeat
Kuchlug At this time another Kara-Khitan army took Samarkand, but the war did
not end here The Muslim again went onto the attack and were only halted near
Balasagun, and even that success was dubious</p>
<p>But then the mass of people intervened in politics and
confused all their rulers&quot; cards The Muslim population of Mavarannahr found
the yoke of their co-religionists from Khwarizm worse than the yoke of the
infidel After several upheavals, all the Khwarizmians in Samarkand were
slaughtered, and their disjointed limbs were hung in the bazaars  <a name="sik3text59"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note59">[+59]</a>
On the other hand, the gurkhan's troops rioted, after recovering the treasury
from Kuchlug they did not return it to the ruler, but divided it amongst
themselves Then Kuchlug renewed his adventurist policy, put himself at the head
of the rioters and in 1211 arrested the gurkhan who was trying to hide in
Kashgar The gurkhan was left his title and all the marks of his dignity, but
Kuchlug stood on a level with the throne and matters were decided at the wave of
his hand The Kara-Khitan grandees, seeing the gurkhan's incapacity, transferred
their sympathy to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{165} </font></b>Kuchlug,
seeing him as a possible saviour of the sinking state. Gurkhan Julqu died in
1213 and Kuchlug was unanimously recognised as the Kara-Khitan gurkhan.</p>
<p>The events described throw light on the Naiman problem. As we
have seen, the Naiman fled to the Kara-Khitan to save themselves from the
Mongols; they regarded them as their fellow-tribesmen and were accepted there as
such. Kuchlug seized power relying on the support of the leaders of the Kara-Khitan
troops, which would have been impossible had he been a stranger. Evidently, the
difference between the Kara-Khitan and the Naiman lay in political, not the
ethnic plane and this confirms our preliminary interpretation of the events.</p>
<p>The religious problem is much more complex. According to all
the data, Kuchlug was at first a Nestorian, but after seizing power he deserted
his wife, a Christian, and fell in love with a Kara-Khitan who seduced him into
&quot;worshipping strange gods&quot;  <a name="sik3text6"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note6">[+6]</a>0
(perhaps Buddhas?).  <a name="sik3text61"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note61">[+61]</a></p>
<p>Thanks to the Mongol forces being tied down in China, Kuchlug
gained a breathing space and made use of it to restore the frontiers of the
Kara-Khitan power. He managed to force back the Khwarizmians in the south and to
subordinate the defecting principalities of Eastern Turkestan, except for
Almalik which had accepted the protection of the Mongols. But, although a good
general, Kuchlug was a bad politician and allowed the Nestorians and Buddhists
to start a <b><font COLOR="#943634">{166} </font></b>religious
persecution of the Muslims who made up the majority of the Kara-Khitai power.
This separated him from the masses who transferred their sympathy to the Mongol
khan, at this time very well disposed towards the Muslims.</p>
<p>In 1218 Kuchlug, catching the ruler of Almalik unawares,
besieged the town where the ruler's wife, a Mongolian, niece of Chinggiskhan,
led the defence. The Mongols immediately came to her aid and Kuchlug was obliged
to withdraw. At the first news of the appearance of the Mongol troops the Muslim
population started to slaughter the adherents of Kuchlug who, not being able to
consolidate his position, fled to the extreme south of the country, to Sarykol
where he was caught by the Mongols and killed. The Kara-Khitai (Khitan)
submitted to the Mongols without resistance and were included in the composition
of the people and troops as a separate corps equal in rights to the truly Mongol
sections.</p>
<p>After 1218 the only remaining enemies of the Mongols in the
steppes were the Kipchak, i.e. the eastern Polovtsy who had helped the Merkit.
War with them dragged on until 1229 when the Mongols took the town of Saksin on
the lower reaches of the Volga or Yaik. The Polovtsy population of the Caspian
and Aral steppes in part fled to the west, in part submitted to the Mongols and
increased the numbers of their troops.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>A Renewed Illusion</h4>
<p>Kuchlug lost his life, but acquired a fame of which he never
dreamt and which he did not deserve. His persecution of the Muslims, as
senseless as the dragonnade of Louis XIV, had unlooked for consequences on the
western marches of Asia. First, the Caliph of Baghdad, who was not on good terms
with the Khwarizmshah, decided to make use of him in the matter. In 1217, at the
request of the Caliph, the Nestorian Patriarch living in Baghdad sent emissaries
to &quot;king David&quot; with a request to mount a diversion against Khwarizm.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik3text62"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note62">[+62]</a></font> But by this time Kuchlug had abandoned his Christian
faith and all his concerns were focussed on Dzungaria, not on Central Asia.
Nevertheless, the rumour crept further and reached the Crusaders who in 1218
were besieging Damietta in Northern Egypt. Part of them, namely Hungarians led
by their king, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{167} </font></b>Andrew
II, reached Acre, made merry in the rich trading town and returned home; but the
others: Germans, Frisians, Danes, Norwegians, prompted by the papal legate
Pelagius who was in contact with the cunning Italian merchants, set off for
Egypt in May 1218. To start with the Crusaders won a few battles and even took
Damietta, but, lacking any prospect of further advances, they left Egypt in
1221.</p>
<p>It was at this time that the rumour of the eastern ally took
root and this time in the following form: &quot;Throughout the Christian world
there were rumours that the Indian king David, called priest John, is
approaching with a large force, he has conquered Persia, Media [in this case,
Central Asia] and many other Saracen lands and informed the Caliph of Baghdad,
Baldakh, the supreme pope of the Saracens, that he wishes to wage war against
him and against all heathen, if he does not accept the Christian faith. And he
has promised to come to the help of the Christian troops at Damietta and in the
land of Jerusalem&quot;.  <a name="sik3text63"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note63">[+63]</a></p>
<p>Jacques de Vitry, Bishop of Acre, in a letter to Pope
Honorius III writes still more extensively and pathetically about &quot;king
David&quot;, who &quot;is called by the people priest John&quot; and &quot;like
unto David, the holy king of Israel... crowned by the will of Providence&quot;.
The date of the letter is 18 April 1221. At that time Kuchlug's bones had
rotted, but hope of his help continued to obscure the minds of Europeans. De
Vitry, among other stupidities, asserts that king David's troops &quot;are
already no more than 15 days journey from Antioch and are hurrying to reach the
Promised Land to see Our Lord's sepulchre and restore the Holy Land&quot;, i.e.
the Kingdom of Jerusalem conquered by Sala ad-Din in 1187. The information
underlying the letter had been obtained by the Bishop of Acre from soldiers who
had fallen into the hands of the Muslims and been sent to the east, to Baghdad
where the Caliph handed them over to &quot;king David&quot; and he, learning
they were Christians, freed them and sent them to Antioch.  <a name="sik3text64"></a><a href="sik3a.htm#sik3note64">[+64]</a></p>
<p>This last detail still awaits explanation, although its
reliability, or, rather, probability, seems very small. It is not impossible
that <b><font COLOR="#943634">{168} </font></b>Christian
prisoners were in the area where the Mongols were operating, smashing the
Khwarizm sultanate in these years. It is possible that they encountered the
Mongols, or simply fled to them and found co-religionists there among the Kerait
or Naiman serving in the Mongol army. There is nothing improbable in the Mongol
soldiers helping the enemies of their enemies and giving them the chance to make
their way back to their own people. But these are only the details of an
unwritten historical novel, and all that relates to history itself is distorted
beyond recognition. In any case, the text quoted is the last chronologically of
the legends and deceptive hopes. In the thirteenth century the bitter, sobering
reality was disclosed to the Europeans.</p>

was written down 58 years after it had been spoken, if it was In the light of
this fact alone, there could be no literal precision. Researchers (linguists,
literature specialists and historians) consider this phrase the cause of the
start of military activities, but they translate it in very different ways.
Thus, Palladii Kafarov, who translated the Secret History from a Chinese
version, gives this version of the problem phrase &quot;Jamuqa said 'Now, if we
stop by the mountain, those pasturing the horses will get the yurts, if along
the current, those pasturing the sheep and lambs will get food for their
throats'&quot; (Palladii, &quot;Starinnoemongol'skoeskazame&quot;,59). S.A.
Kozin, who made a translation from the original, offers another version
&quot;Let us move our nomad pastures around the mountains, the hut is ready for
our herdsmen Let us move our nomad pastures along the rivers, [the food] is
ready for the throats of our shepherds&quot; <i>(Sokrovennoe skazanie, </i>╖
118). But L. Ligeti, translating the same text, makes a different sense of it
&quot;Let our diligent herdsmen find pasture [variant let the mountain be their
pasture] at the very foothills of the mountains. Let us settle there, at the
very bank of the river, let our shepherds there find fodder&quot; (L. Ligeti, <i>A.
Mongolok titkos tortenete, </i>239). There are also other variants, but those
adduced are enough, because it is impossible to make a faithful translation
without understanding the sense of the phrase, and it is the sense which is
unclear. With this not unimportant fact established, we may, and even should,
refrain from attempts to find in &quot;Jamuqa`s riddle&quot; both the answer to
the causes of the creation of the Mongol ulus (cp. V. Bartol'd, &quot;Obrazovanie
imperil Chingiskhana&quot;, <i>Zapiski Vostochnogo otdeleniya Rossuskogo
arkheologicheskogo obshchestva, </i>X, 1896), and the &quot;accentuated
equanimity of a lord full of yearning&quot; (S.A. Kozin, &quot;Yuan-chao bi-shi
kak pamyatnik literatury&quot;, <i>Sokrovennoe skazanie, </i>p 40) Here is a
literary device which we are unable to fathom, since our aesthetic norms and
systems of association differ from those of the thirteenth-century Mongols to
whom the Secret History was addressed The word lives only at the moment it is
spoken with a particular intonation and in specific circumstances Transmitted
through the centuries it dies and &quot;like bees in a deserted hive, dead words
stink&quot; The sense, though, is immortal, but we have to catch it by other
means [The quotation is from the final two lines of a poem &quot;Slovo&quot;
(The Word) written by L.N. Gumilev's father, Nikolai Gumilev, and published in

the ba`aturs who chose Temujin, here it is stressed that the representatives of
tribes, of which there were only ten, chose the khan The Tayichi`ut and Tatars
each had three representatives, the Naiman two and Jamuqa himself, whose Jajirat
tribe was not in the list, held a special place Six tribes were Mongol in the
full sense of the word the Onggirat, Ikires, Qorolas (Kuralas), Qadagin,
Salji`ut and Tayichi`ut, while the last three were from the Nirun section, l e
were related to Chinggiskhan. The Naiman, Oirat, Merkit and Tatars had evidently
been invited as allies and this indicates the nature of the war it had arisen as
a civil, social one, not as an inter-tnbal one. This was why a split within the
tribes continued a Qorolas warrior informed Chinggiskhan of the conspiracy
against him, but the source did not consider this as treachery this warrior
simply chose the side on which he wanted to fight <i>(Sokrovennoe skazanie, </i>╖
141) This feature of the war is stressed below in the episode of the
imprisonment of the Tayichi`ut leader, Targutai, by his troops. They took him to
Chinggis, but released him so as not to lay hands &quot;on their natural
lord&quot; For this, Chinggiskhan praised them and accepted them on service
(ibid , ╖ 149). So warriors themselves, according to the ethical norms of the
day, had the right to select the banner they would serve, but not to engage in
personal disrespect. The ethical system of the Mongols so differed from the
concepts of the China and Europe of their day that conflicts frequently arose
merely from mutual misunderstanding what seemed to the Mongols a crime was
normal for Europeans, and vice versa.</p>

but while shepherds and <i>arat </i>fled to Chinggiskhan, noble noyans, for
example, Altan, Quchar and even Chinggiskhan's brother Qasar grouped around

inter-tribal one, but rather a social one, a resolution of the argument between
the &quot;people of long will&quot;, who became noyans after their victory, and
the tribal nobility Only thus can one interpret the thesis of &quot;Mongol
nomadic feudalism&quot; without contradicting the facts.</p>
