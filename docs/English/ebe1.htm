<h4 align="center">What It's About and Why It's Important</h4>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Fear of disenchantment.</strong></font> </i>When a
reader of our day buys and opens a new book on history or ethnography, he is not sure he
will even read it to the middle. It may seem boring to him, mindless, or just not to his
taste. Still it's all right for the reader- he's simply lost a few dollars or
roubles. But
what of the author? The collecting of information. The posing of the problem. Decades of
searching for the answer. Years at his desk. Discussions with publishers'
readers. Battle
with the editor. And suddenly it's all to no purpose-the book isn't interesting! It lies
in libraries ... and no one takes it out. Which means his life has been in vain.</p>

<p>That is so terrible that one must take steps to avoid such a result. But what steps?
During his training at university and in postgraduate studies it is often hammered into
the future author that his job is to copy out as many passages as possible from sources,
to put them into some kind of order, and to draw a conclusion: in antiquity there were
slave owners and slaves. The slave owners were baddies but things were good for them; the
slaves were goodies, but it was tough for them.</p>

<p>All that, of course, is correct but that's the trouble. No one wants to read about
that, even the author himself. First of all, because it is so well known, and secondly,
because it does not explain, for example, why some armies won, and others were defeated,
and why some countries grew stronger and others weaker. And, finally, why powerful ethnoi
arose, and where they vanished to, although there was obviously no complete extinction of
their members.</p>

<p>All these matters are wholly related to my chosen theme, i.e. the sudden strengthening
of one people or another and their subsequent disappearance. A clear example of that is
the Mongols in the twelfth to seventeenth centuries. But that pattern has also governed
other peoples. The late B.Ya. Vladimirtsov formulated the problem succinctly: 'I want to
understand how and why all that happened'; but like other scholars, he did not provide an
answer. I shall come back to this subject time and again, firmly convinced that the reader
will not shut the book at the second page.</p>

<p>Quite clearly, in order to solve the problem posed we must first of all investigate the
method of research. Otherwise it would have been solved long ago, because the facts are so
numerous that the point is not one of adding to them but of selecting those that relate to
the matter in hand. Even contemporary chroniclers have drowned in a sea of information
that has not brought them closer to understanding the problem. Archaeologists and
chroniclers have assembled, published, and commented on much information over the past
centuries, and orientalists have increased the stock of knowledge even more, codifying
sources in various languages Chinese, Persian, Latin, Greek, Armenian, and Arabic. The
amount of information has grown, but has not developed into a new quality. It has still
remained unclear how a small tribe sometimes gained hegemony over half the world, then
increased in numbers, and later disappeared.</p>

<p>I have posed the question of the extent of our knowledge, or rather ignorance of the
subject this study is devoted to.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="center">On the Usefulness of Ethnography and the Difficulties to Be
Surmounted</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The dissimilarity of ethnoi.</strong></font> </i>When
a people has lived for a long time in its homeland it seems to its members that their mode
of life, manners of behaviour, tastes, opinions, and social relationships, that is to say
everything that is now called the 'stereotype of behaviour', are the only possible and
correct ones. And if any deviations are encountered anywhere, it is because of 'ignorance', by which is often understood simply dissimilarity from
themselves. I remember
when I was a child and was fond of Mayne Reid, a very cultured lady said to me:
'Negroes
are muzhiks just like ours, only black'. It could not have occurred to her that a
Melanesian witch-doctor might say with equal grounds: 'Englishmen are headhunters just
like us, only white'. Narrow-minded Philistine judgments sometimes seem internally
logical, even though based on ignorance of reality. But they immediately crumble when
confronted with it.</p>

<p>Ethnography was not topical for the mediaeval scholars of Western Europe. Europeans'
communion with other cultures was limited to the Mediterranean basin, on the coasts of
which lived descendants of subjects of the Roman Empire, some of them converted to Islam.
That, of course, separated them from the 'Franks and 'Latins', i.e. from the French and
Italians, but the existence of common cultural roots made the difference not so big as to
exclude mutual understanding. But in the age of the great geographical discoveries the
position was radically changed. While it then seemed justified to call Negroes, Papuans,
or North American Indians 'savages', that could not be said of the Chinese, or about the
Hindus, the Aztecs, or the Incas. Other explanations had to be found.</p>

<p>In the sixteenth century, European travelers and explorers, discovering lands remote
for them, involuntarily began to look in them for analogies of the forms of life they were
used to. The Spanish Conquistadors began to give baptized caciques the title 'Don',
considering them Indian noblemen. The chiefs of Negro tribes were elevated to the rank of
'kings'. Tungus shamans were considered priests, although they were simply doctors who saw
the cause of illness in the influence of evil 'spirits' that were just as material in
their understanding as animals or members of other tribes. Mutual incomprehension was
intensified by a conviction that there was nothing to understand, and then collisions
occurred that led to the murder of Europeans who wounded the feelings of the aborigines,
in response to which brutal punitive expeditions were organized. The civilized Australian
aborigine Waipuldanya or Phillip Roberts relates stories of tragedies that were the more
terrible that they happened without visible causes. Thus aborigines killed a white man who
was smoking a cigarette, considering him a spirit that had fire in its belly. They ran
another through with a spear because he had drawn a watch from his pocket and looked at
the sun. The aborigines decided that he was carrying the sun in his pocket.
Misunderstandings like that were followed by punitive expeditions that led to the
extermination of whole tribes. And tragic collisions occurred for Australian Aborigines
and the Papuans of New Guinea not only with whites but also with Malays, collisions that
were aggravated by the transmission of infections.</p>

<p>Fairly recently, on 30 October 1968, on the bank of the Rio Negro, a tributary of the
Amazon, the Indians killed a missionary and eight of his companions for nothing, from
their point of view, but tactlessness. The padre, having come to the Atroari's country,
announced his arrival by shots, which was improper according to their customs; he went
into a small hut, despite the protest of its owner; he tweaked the ear of a child; and
forbade them to take his saucepan of soup. Only the guide survived, who knew the Indians'
customs and abandoned Father Cagliari, who had paid no attention to his advice and had
forgotten that the people who live on the banks of the Po were not quite like those on the
banks of the Amazon.</p>

<p>Some time passed before it was asked whether it was not better to adapt oneself to the
aborigines than to exterminate them. In order to do that, however, it was necessary to
admit that peoples of other cultures differed from Europeans, and from one another, not
only in languages and beliefs but also in the whole 'stereotype of behaviour', which it
was a good idea to study so as to avoid conflicts. So ethnography arose, the science of
the differences between peoples.</p>

<p>Colonialism has gone, under the blows of the national liberation movement, but
interethnic contacts have remained and been extended. The problem of establishing mutual
understanding has consequently become more and more urgent on both the global scale of
world politics and the microscopic, personal scale during meetings with people who are not
like us. And so a new question has been posed, a theoretical one despite its practical
significance. But why are we, people, so unlike one another that we must adapt ourselves
to one another? Must study others' manners and customs, look for acceptable ways of
intercourse instead of those that seem natural to us, are quite adequate for intraethnic
intercourse and satisfactory for contacts with our neighbors? In some cases ethnic
dissimilarity can be explained by diversity of geographical conditions, yet it is also
observed where climate and relief are similar. Obviously, one cannot do without history.</p>

<p>In fact various peoples arose in various ages and had different historical fates, which
left traces on them as ineffaceable as personal biographies that mould the character of
individuals. The geographical environment influences ethnoi, of course, through man's
everyday communion with the nature that feeds him, but that is not all. Traditions
inherited from ancestors and traditional enmity or friendship with neighbors (the ethnic
environment) play their role; cultural influences and religion have their significance,
but in addition to all that there is the law of evolution or development, which applies to
ethnoi just like other phenomena of nature. It is manifested in the multifarious processes
of the rise and disappearance of peoples that I call ethnogenesis. Unless we allow for the
peculiarities of this form of the motion of matter we cannot find the key to the riddle of
ethnic psychology on either the practical or the theoretical plane. We need both, but
unexpected difficulties crop up on the path I have elected.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><i>The complexities of the terminology employed. </i></strong></font>The
abundance of initial information and the poor development of the principles of
systematizing are felt particularly painfully in history and ethnography. For the
bibliography alone fills volumes, to look into which is sometimes no simpler than looking
into the scientific problems themselves. The reader needs to be able to see the whole
aggregate of events simultaneously (the principle of actualism), or all the modes of
formation (the principle of evolutionism), and not a multi-volume list of the titles of
articles and papers, for the most part out of date. The works of the founders of Marxism
contain the program of a systematic approach to understanding historical process, but it
has not yet been applied to questions of ethnogenesis.</p>

<p>Some attempts to introduce a systems method are known in old, often forgotten
historiography but, in contrast to the natural sciences, their authors met with neither
understanding nor sympathy. Polybius's conception is now regarded as an elegant rarity,
ibn Khaidun's (fourteenth century) as a curiosity. Giovanni Battista Vico is remembered
only in the history of science, while the grandiose, though perhaps unsuccessful
constructions of N.Ya. Danilevsky, Oswald Spengler, and Arnold Toynbee have become an
excuse for rejecting the construction of historical models in general. The result of this
process is unambiguous. Since it is impossible to remember the whole concatenation of
historical events and since there is not and cannot be a common terminology in the absence
of a systems even communion among Historians gets more difficult year by year.</p>

<p>By attaching various nuances to terms and investing them with a different content,
historians convert them into polysemantic words. In the first stages of this process the
speakers can be understood from the context, intonation, and situation in which the
dispute is conducted, but in the last phases this unsatisfactory degree of understanding
disappears. So the Russian word <i>rod </i>(gens, family) is usually employed for the
concept 'clan or gentile system', but the 'clan <i>(rod) </i>of the Shuisky boyars'
clearly has no relation to that. It is even worse with translation: if a clan (gens) is a
Celtic clan, it is impossible to call any Kazakh branch of the Middle or Junior <i>Zhus
(ru)<b> </b></i>such, or the Altain <i>kost (seok), </i>and -vice versa, because they
differ in functions and genesis. Yet all these, by no means dissimilar phenomena are named
identically and, worse, are equated on that basis with one another. Willy-nilly the
historian studies not the object but words that have already lost their meaning as real
phenomena<b>, </b>while the latter elude him. Let us now assume that three historians are
discussing a problem, one of them investing the concept 'gens' with the sense of clan, the
second of <i>seok, </i>the third of the boyar family. Obviously they not only will not
understand one another, but even what they are talking about.</p>

<p>It may be objected, of course, that agreement can be reached about terms, but the
number of concepts increases proportionately with the accumulation of information; ever
new terms are appearing that, in the absence of a system, become polysemantic and
consequently useless for analysis and synthesis. But a way out can also be found here.</p>

<p>So far I have been speaking of the conditions of research; let me now speak about its
perspectives. Study of any subject only has practical significance when it is possible to
survey it as a whole. The electrical engineer, for example, must deal with the phenomena
of ionization and thermal efficiency, the electromagnetic field, etc., but not to the same
degree; the physical geographer, when speaking of Earth's envelopes, has in mind the
troposphere, hydrosphere, lithosphere, and even the biosphere. But the historian can only
draw conclusions that are more weighty and interesting for the reader when he covers a
broad complex of interconnected events in a single argument, at the same time reaching
agreement on terminology. It is difficult, but not impossible. It is simply important for
the conclusions to correspond to all the facts taken into consideration. If anyone puts
forward a more elegant and convincing conception for the facts cited in my book, I shall
bow to him with respect. But if, on the contrary, anyone declared my conclusions
final,
not requiring review and further elaboration, I would not agree with him. Ordinary books
do not live longer than people, and the development of science is an immanent law of the
shaping of mankind. I therefore see it as my job to pay what honour I can to Beautiful
Lady History, without whom no people can exist, and to her Wise Sister Geography, who
creates people's bond with their ancestress, the Biosphere of Planet Earth. <a name="ebe1text1"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note1">[+1]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Summaries and scruples.</strong></font> </i>The
species <i>Homo sapiens, </i>which has spread over the whole land surface of the
planet,
and a considerable part of its marine surface, has made such significant changes in its
configuration that they can be equated with small scale upheavals. <a name="ebe1text2"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note2">[+2]</a>
But it follows from this that we distinguish a special historico-geographical category of
laws that requires a special method for examining and studying them that combines
historical and geographical techniques of research. In itself that is nothing
new, but the
approach to the problem has so far been eclectic: the use of C14 
analysis, for example, to date archaeological finds, of resistivity prospecting
(a business too
laborious for practical application), and of cybernetic techniques to study 'stone
Venuses' (which has given the same results as visual estimates), and so on. But the most
important thing has been lost sight of! In my view this 'main point' is the ability to
extract information from the silence of the sources. The inductive way limits the
historian's opportunities to a simple or critical rendering of foreign words, the limit of
the investigation moreover being distrust of the source. But this result is negative and
therefore not conclusive. Only the establishing of a certain number of indisputable facts
will be positive, and these, being derived layer by layer from the source, can be reduced
to a chronological table or plotted on a historical map. In order to interpret
them, a
philosopheme or postulate is needed, but that infringes the accepted principle of
inductive research. A blind alley!</p>

<p>So! But the geographer, geologist, zoologist, and soil scientist never have more
facts,
yet their sciences develop which happens because natural scientists employ 'empirical
generalization' instead of a philosophical postulate and it, according to
Vernadsky, has a
reliability equal to observed fact. <a name="ebe1text3"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note3">[+3]</a> In other words, the
natural sciences overcome the silence of the sources and even extract something useful for
science from it, since they avoid the false that is always contained in a source or
introduced by ourselves through inadequate perception. So why reject sources because of
that? When taking nature as a source we also have to resort to a method of study, but that
gives us wonderful prospects that enable us to lift the veil of Isis.</p>

<p>One of the tasks of science is to obtain the maximum information from a minimum of
facts, to make it possible to single out precise patterns that enable the most varied
phenomena to be understood from a single point of view, and subsequently learn to find
one's bearings in them. These patterns are invisible but not invented. They are discovered
through generalization. Let me give an example from biology.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">Stars and planets move across the sky. Balloons rise, but a stone
  dropped from a cliff falls in space. Rivers run to the sea, and sediments slowly settle in
  the ocean forming layers of sedimentary rocks. Mice have very thin paws and elephants huge
  extremities. Land animals do not attain the size of whales and giant squid. What do those
  facts have in common? They are all based on the law of universal gravitation, which is
  intertwined with other laws, just as real, invisible, but mentally
  comprehensible. <a name="ebe1text4"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note4">[+4]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Terrestrial gravitation has always existed but it needed the insight of Newton
observing the fall of an apple from a branch for people to recognize its existence. And
how many other powerful forces of nature that surround us and govern our fate lie outside
our understanding. We live in an underdiscovered world and often move feeling our way,
which sometimes leads to tragic consequences. That is why the magic eyes of science, by
which I mean the insight of scientists of genius, are needed in order to understand the
world around us and our place in it, and to learn to foresee even the immediate
consequences of our actions.</p>

<p>Studies to establish the functional link of phenomena of physical geography and
paleontology in material of the history of Central Asia and the archaeology of the Lower
Volga, enable us to draw three conclusions. (1) The historical fate of an ethnos resulting
from its economic activity is directly linked with the dynamic state of the area occupied.
(2) The archaeological culture of an ethnos, which is a crystallized trace of its
historical fate, reflects the paleogeographical state of the terrain in an era amenable to
absolute dating. (3) The combination of historical and archaeological material makes it
possible to judge the character of the areas occupied in one age or another, and
consequently the character of their changes.</p>

<p>Precision is relative here, of course, but a tolerance of plus or minus 50 years for
diffuse boundaries does not affect the conclusions and is consequently innocuous. Much
more dangerous is the striving for scrupulousness in the direct sense of the word.</p>

<p><i>Scrupulus </i>(Lat.) means a bit of grit that has got into a sandal and is
irritating the sole of the foot. The ancients considered it is senseless business to study
the distribution of these grits; one simply had to take off one's sandal and shake it. The
word 'scrupulousness' therefore meant unnecessary concern about trifles. Now the word is
used in the sense of 'superexact'.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the demand for 'scrupulousness' is not always innocent and harmless, in
particular when natural phenomena are being correlated with historical events, because the
legitimate tolerance may be as much as 50 or 60 years, and cannot be reduced since the
link being sought is mediated by the economic geography of ancient epochs. The system of
livelihood, cultivation, stock-breeding, or even hunting, has its own inertia. If it is
undermined, say, by drought, the state founded on it is only weakened when reserves are
exhausted, and the constant malnutrition (and not short-term famine) undermines the
strength of the reproductive population. This process can only be discovered through a
broad integration of a number of historical events, and not by a scrupulous correlating of
natural and historical phenomena. In that connection one must remember the words of a
famous natural scientist:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">you could never learn what a mouse is like by carefully examining
  each of its cells separately under the electron microscope any more than you could
  appreciate the beauty of a cathedral through the chemical analysis or each stone that went
  into its construction. <a name="ebe1text5"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note5">[+5]</a> </p>
</blockquote>

<p>Of course, when we examine one or even two facts in isolation from others, we remain
trapped by old authors who were able to impose their opinion with skill and talent on the
reader. But when we extract direct information from sources, and take not two facts but 2
000, we then get several causal chains that not only correlate with one another but also
with the model we propose. It is not a simple functional dependence like that sought in
the eighteenth century by champions of geographical determinism like Montesquieu. Here we
find a systemic link, underlying the science of the relationship of mankind and nature.</p>

<p>The universality and specificity of the interaction I have noted makes it possible to
single out study of it as an independent boundary field of science, and as a combination
of history and geography, called ethnology. But here there is a new sore point. Can we
find a tangible definition of ethnos?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Limits.</strong></font> </i>What do we know precisely
about ethnoi? Very much and very little. We have no grounds for asserting that an ethnos
occurred as a phenomenon in the Lower Paleolithic. Behind the high brow ridges, and within
the huge brainbox of Neanderthal man, were lodged thoughts and feelings. But what they
were we still have no right even to guess if we want to remain on a platform of scientific
authenticity and reliability. We know more about the people of the Upper
Paleolithic. They
were splendid hunters, made spears and javelins, dressed in clothes of animal
skins, and
drew no worse than the Parisian Impressionists. The form of their collective life was
seemingly similar to those that are known to us, but that is only a supposition on which
we cannot even build a scientific hypothesis. It is not excluded that there were features
in ancient times that have not come down to us.</p>

<p>But we can consider the peoples of the Late Neolithic and Bronze Ages (third and second
millennia B.C.) similar to historical ones with a high degree of probability.
Unfortunately, our knowledge of the ethnic differences then is fragmentary and scanty, so
that if we rely on it we risk not distinguishing the patterns that interest us at the
moment from local features and, by taking the particular for the general or -vice versa,
falling into error.</p>

<p>So-called historical time gives us reliable material for analysis, when written sources
throw light on the history of ethnoi and their interconnections. We have the right, when
studying this period of time, to apply the observations obtained to earlier times and to
fill the gaps in our knowledge arising in the first stage of study by extrapolation. We
thus avoid the aberrations of distance, one of the most frequent mistakes of the
historical critic.</p>

<p>It is convenient to take the beginning of the nineteenth century as the upper date
because we need only completed processes in order to establish patterns. One can only
speak of uncompleted processes for purposes of forecasting, but for that we have to have a
formula of regularity available - the same as the one we are looking for. In addition,
when we are studying twentieth-century phenomena, there is the possibility of an
aberration of propinquity by which phenomena lose scale just as with the aberration of
distance. I shall therefore limit myself to the 3 000 years between the twelfth century
B.C. and the nineteenth century A.D., for posing the problem, or for clarity of
representation, from the fall of Troy to the overthrow of Napoleon.</p>

<p>To begin with I shall investigate our abundant material by a synchronic method, basing
myself on a comparison and collation of information about whose reliability there is no
doubt. The new element that I shall decide to introduce will be the combining of facts in
the aspect I propose. That is necessary because the kaleidoscope of dates in the various
chronological tables does not give the reader any idea of what happened with peoples
throughout their historical life. The method proposed is not as characteristic of the
humanities, as it is of the natural sciences. Empirical generalization is neither a
hypothesis nor a popularization, although it is built on facts already assembled and
tested rather than on original material (experience, observation, and reading of primary
sources). The introduction of material into the system and the construction of a
conception is the middle stage of comprehension of the problem that precedes philosophical
generalization. For my purposes I need precisely this middle stage.</p>

<p>It would seem that the more detailed and numerous the information about a subject the
easier it is to form an exhaustive idea of it. But is that so in fact? Most likely not.
Unnecessary and too fine information, while not altering the picture as a whole, creates
what they call 'noise' or 'interference' in cybernetics and the study of systems. But for
other purposes it is precisely nuances of mood that are needed. In short, in order to
clarify the nature of phenomena one must take in the whole concatenation of facts relating
to the problem under consideration, but not all the information available in the arsenal
of science.</p>

<p>But what are we to take as 'relating to the problem'? The answer will obviously be
different in different cases. The history of mankind and the biographies of famous people
are not equal phenomena, and the pattern of development will be different in both cases,
but there are as many gradations as you like between them. The point is complicated by the
fact that any historical phenomenon (war, the promulgation of a law, the building of an
architectural monument, the founding of a princedom or republic, and so on) has to be
treated in several degrees of approximation, the comparison of which, moreover, yields
contradictory results at first glance. Let me take an example from the history of Europe.
After the Reformation a struggle began between the Protestant Union and the Catholic
League (approximation A). Consequently all the Protestants of Western Europe should have
been battling against all the Catholics. But Catholic France was a member of the
Protestant Union, and Protestant Denmark stabbed Protestant Sweden in the back in 1643,
i.e. political interests were put before ideological ones (approximation B). Does that
mean that the first statement was not true? By no means. It was only more generalized. In
addition, mercenaries fought in the armies of both sides, for the most part indifferent to
religion, but avid for plunder. That means that one could characterize the Thirty Years'
War in the next approximation (C) as an orgy of banditry, and that, too, would be to some
extent correct. Finally, real class interests lay behind the religious slogans and the
golden diadems of kings, interests it would be wrong not to take into account
(approximation D). And one can add to that the separatist tendencies of the different,
separate regions (approximation E) discoverable by paleoethnography, and so on.</p>

<p>As will be seen from this example, the system of successive approximations is a
complicated business, even when we are investigating a local episode. Nevertheless we need
not lose hope of success because there remains the path of scientific deduction. Just as
the motion of Earth is composed of many regular motions (rotation around its axis,
rotation around the sun, movement with all the planets of the solar system through the
galaxy, and many others), so mankind, the anthroposphere, experiences in developing not
one but several effects that are studied by separate sciences. The spontaneous movement,
reflected in social development, is studied by historical materialism; human physiology is
a field of biology; man's relation with the landscape - historical geography - lies in
the, sphere of the geographical sciences; the study of wars, laws, and institutions is
political history, and of opinion and thoughts the history of culture; the study of
languages is linguistics, and of literary creation philology, and so on. Where does our
problem fit in?</p>

<p>Let me begin with the point that an ethnos (any one), like a language, for example, is
not a social phenomenon, because it can exist in several formations. The influence of
spontaneous social development on the molding of an ethnos is exogenous. In order to
affect the forming or the break-up of an ethnos, social development operates through
history, both political and cultural. One can therefore say that the problem of
ethnogenesis lies on the boundary of historical science where its social aspects pass
smoothly into the natural ones.</p>

<p>Since all phenomena of ethnogenesis originate on the earth's surface in certain
geographical conditions, the question of the role of terrain and relief inevitably arises,
as a factor presenting economic opportunities for human collectives (ethnoi). <a name="ebe1text6"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note6">[+6]</a>
But the combination of history and geography is not sufficient for my problem because it
is a matter of living organisms which, as we know, are always in a state of evolution or
involution, or monomorphism (stability within the species), and interact with other living
organisms, forming communities, and geobiocoenoses.</p>

<p>I must thus put my problem at the junction of three sciences: history, geography (study
of relief), and biology (ecology and genetics). But that being so, we can make a second
approximation of the definition of the term 'ethnos': an ethnos is a specific form of
existence of the species <i>Homo sapiens, </i>and ethnogenesis is a local variant of the
intraspecific form-making determined by a combination of historical and choronomic
(landscape) factors.</p>

<p>The aspect in which mankind appears as an anthropofauna may seem extravagant, but
Darwin and Engels laid the foundations for such a study. Following the scientific
tradition, I shall turn my attention to this aspect of human activities which has been
missed by most of my predecessors.</p>

Man's dependence on the world around him, or rather on his geographical environment, is
never disputed, although the degree of dependence is assessed differently by different
scholars. In any case, however, the economic life of the peoples who have inhabited Earth
and now live in it is closely linked with the relief and climate of the territories
inhabited. It is quite difficult to trace the rise and decline of the economy of ancient
periods, again because of the incompleteness of the information obtained from primary
sources. But there is an excellent indicator - military power. As for modern times, there
are no doubts whatsoever about that, but for 2 000 years matters remained precisely the
same, for nomads as well as for settled peoples. Not only were well-fed, strong, tireless
people needed for a campaign, capable of drawing a bow 'to the ear' (which enabled an
arrow to be shot for 700 meters while with drawing 'to the eye' the range of an arrow was
350-400 meters), and of fencing with a heavy sword or (much harder) with a curved saber.
It was also necessary to have horses, roughly four or five per man, taking the wagon train
or pack train into account. A stock of arrows was needed, and making them was a laborious
business. Stocks of provisions were needed, for example, for nomads, a flock of sheep and
consequently shepherds for it. A reserve guard was needed to protect women and children.
In short, war required funds even then, and big ones at that. It could only be waged at
the enemy's expense after the first, considerable victory, and in order to win it a strong
rear was required, a prosperous economy, and consequently optimum natural conditions.</p>

<p>The significance of geographical conditions, for example, relief, for military history
has long been talked about, always, one might even say. Suffice it to recall some examples
from ancient history. Hannibal won the battle of Lake Trasimene by making use of several
deep valleys disposed at right angles to the lake's shore and the road along which the
Roman troops passed. Thanks to that he attacked the Roman army in three places at once and
won the battle. At Cynoscephalae the Macedonian phalanx was scattered on broken ground,
and the Romans easily broke the heavily armed enemy, who had lost formation. Examples like
these have always been in historians' field of vision and gave the eighteenth-century
Russian scholar Ivan Boltin grounds for a famous comment: 'The historian who is not strong
in geography stumbles'. <a name="ebe1text7"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note7">[+7]</a> But it is pointless to dwell on such
an obvious problem in the twentieth century, because history is now faced with more
profound tasks than it used to be, while geography has moved away from simple description
of the marvels of our planet and has acquired possibilities that were inaccessible to our
ancestors.</p>

<p>I shall therefore put the question differently: not only how does the geographical
environment affect people 6ut also how far do people themselves constitute part of the
envelope of Earth that is now called the biosphere; and also to what extent, precisely, do
the patterns of mankind's life influence the geographical environment and to what extent
do they not. That posing of the matter calls for analysis, i.e. an artificial breaking
down of the problem for convenience of investigation. It consequently has only subsidiary
significance for understanding history, since the aim of our work is a synthesis. Alas,
however, just as one cannot build a house without a foundation so it is impossible to
generalize without preliminary differentiation. Let us limit ourselves to the minimum.
When we speak of the history of mankind we usually have in mind the social form of the
movement of history, i.e. mankind's progressive development, as a whole, along a spiral.
This is a spontaneous movement and for that reason cannot be a function of any external
causes whatsoever. Neither geographical nor biological effects can influence that aspect
of history. So what do they influence? Organisms including human ones. L.S. Berg had
already drawn that conclusion in 1922, legitimate for all organisms, including people.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">The geographical landscape necessarily affects the organism,
  compelling all individuals to vary in a certain direction insofar as the organization of
  the species permits. The tundra, forest, steppe, desert, mountains, water medium, life on
  islands, etc. all put a special stamp on organisms. Those species that are incapable of
  adapting must migrate to another geographical terrain or perish. <a name="ebe1text8"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note8">[+8]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>But by 'terrain' is meant</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">a sector of the earth's surface that differs qualitatively from
  other sectors, framed by natural boundaries, and representing a whole, and reciprocally
  conditioned, natural aggregate of objects and phenomena typically expressed over a
  considerable area and inseparably linked in all respects with the topographical
  envelope.  <a name="ebe1text9"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note9">[+9]</a>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Berg called this thesis the choronomic principle of evolution (from the Greek <i>choros,
</i>place), so linking geography and biology. In the aspect I have adopted history is
added to these two sciences, yet the principle remains unshakeable. Furthermore it has
received unexpected confirmation, and that obliges me to continue the examination of an
ethnos's patterns of development, but now with allowance for the dynamic moment, the
development of new ethnoi, i.e. of ethnogenesis, on the basis of a description of the <i>phases
of ethnogenesis. </i>But that is the theme of another chapter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="center">Nature and History</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The combination of nature study and history.</strong></font>
</i>In antiquity, when the world seemed a whole to man, in spite of its obvious diversity,
and interconnected, in spite of the seeming isolation, the problem of coupling natural
science and history could not even arise. All events considered worthy of perpetuation
were entered in the annals. Wars and floods, revolutions and epidemics, the birth of a
genius and the flight of a comet were all considered phenomena of equal significance and
interest for posterity. The principle of the magi then prevailed in scientific thought,
viz., 'like breeds like', which made it possible, through broad associations, to catch the
connections between phenomena of nature and the fates of people or of 'individual persons.
That principle was developed into astrology and <i>mantikй </i>(the lore of divination),
but with the development of the separate sciences, as knowledge accumulated, it was
discarded as unsound, and not substantiated in practical application.</p>

<p>In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, thanks to the differentiation of the
sciences, a huge amount of information was accumulated, which had become vast by the
beginning of the twentieth century. Figuratively speaking the mighty river of Science had
been diverted into irrigation ditches. Life-giving moisture watered a broad area, but the
lake previously fed by it (i.e. integral world-contemplation) dried up. And now the autumn
wind drifts the bottom sediments and blows salty dust onto the friable land of fields.
Soon, in the place of steppe which, even though dry, fed herds, salt marshes arise, and
the biosphere gives way to inert matter, not forever, of course, but for a long time. For
when people quit a doomed land, the ditches begin to silt up, and the river again cuts a
channel, and fills a natural depression. The wind blows a fine layer of fresh dust over
the salt marshes, grasses sprout and die, uneaten by ungulates. In a few centuries a humus
layer is formed on the plain, and plankton in the lake; then herbivores arrive, and
waterfowl carry fish spawn to the lake on their feet. Life again triumphs in its
diversity.</p>

<p>So it is in science. Narrow specialization is only useful as a means of accumulating
knowledge. The differentiation of disciplines was a stage, necessary and inevitable, that
inevitably becomes disastrous when dragged out for a long time. Accumulation of
information without its systematization into an object of broad generalization is a quite
senseless task. Were the principles of ancient science indeed false? Perhaps its
unsoundness was not rooted in its postulates, but rather in lack of skill in applying
them. For there is an interaction 'of the history of nature and the history of men' that
can be caught by employing the total of accumulated knowledge and a method of research
that is developing under our eyes. So I shall endeavor to follow this path and to
formulate the problem as follows: can the study of history be of benefit for interpreting
phenomena of nature?</p>

<p>Social and natural phenomena are obviously not identical, but they do have a point of
contact somewhere. And it is necessary to find it, because it cannot be the anthroposphere
as a whole. Even if we understand the anthroposphere as the biomass, we must note two
aspects of the phenomenon: (a) its <i>mosaic structure, </i>because various collectives of
people interact differently with the environment; if we take into account the well-known
history of the past <i>5 </i>000 years, this diversity and elucidation of its causes will
prove the key to the problem posed; (b) the <i>many-sided character </i>of the object
being studied, i.e. mankind. This has to be understood in the sense that every person (or
mankind as a whole) is a physical body, and an organism, and the upper fink of any
biocoenosis, and a member of a society, and a member of a people or ethnic national
grouping, and so on. In each of these the object (in this case man) is studied by a
corresponding scientific discipline, which does not deny other aspects of research. It is
the ethnic aspect of mankind as a whole that is important for my problem.</p>

<p>Let me make a slight excursus into epistemology. Ask yourself what is accessible to
direct observation. It is not the object itself, but the limits of object. Thus we know
that time, as a category, exists, but unless we see its limits we have no chance of giving
a generally accepted definition of time. And the greater the contrast, the clearer objects
a-re for us that we do not see but dream up, i.e. imagine.</p>

<p>We constantly observe history as a chain of events; consequently history is a boundary.
Happily we know of what - the social and the four natural forms of the motion of matter.
That being so there is, together with the sociosphere and the technosphere generated by
it, a living essence that not only surrounds people but is also within them. And these
elements are so contrast that they are caught by human consciousness without the least
effort. Humanitarian conceptions have proved unnecessary, or rather inadequate, precisely
because they pose the question of the influence on the historical process, or processes,
of geographical, biological, social, or ('in idealist systems) spiritual factors, and not
of the connection of the one and the other, thanks to which both the process itself and
its components become accessible to empirical generalization. The approach suggested here
is nothing other than the analysis, i.e. 'breaking down', needed to untangle the unclear
places in history and then pass on to a synthesis in which the results of the various
methods of research are taken into account.</p>

<p>In the historiography of the nineteenth century the interaction of the social and
natural was not always allowed for. <a name="ebe1text10"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note10">[+10]</a> But now the dynamics of
natural processes has been sufficiently studied for their comparability with social events
to be obvious. Biocoenology has shown that man enters the biocoenosis of the terrain as an
upper final link, because he is a major predator and, as such, is dependent on the
evolution of nature, which by no means rules out the existence of an additional element,
i.e. the development of the productive forces, which produce the technosphere, lacking
self-develop<i>ment </i>and capable only of disrupting.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Formations and ethnoi.</strong></font> </i>If,
however, we look at all world history, we will note that coincidences of changes of
formation and the appearance of new peoples are only rare exceptions, while ethnoi very
dissimilar to one another constantly arise and develop within a formation.</p>

<p>Take the example of the thirteenth century when feudalism nourished from the Atlantic
to the Pacific. The French barons were hardly like the free peasants of Scandinavia, the
slave-warrior Mamelukes of Egypt, the unruly population of the Russian <i>veche</i> towns,
the indigent conquerors of half the world, the Mongol nomads, or the Chinese landowners of
the Sung Empire. Common to them all was the feudal mode of production, but little else.
Agriculturists' and nomads' attitudes to nature did not coincide; receptivity of things
foreign, or capacity for cultural borrowings, was higher in Europe than in China, no less
than the striving for territorial conquests that stimulated the Crusades; Russian
slash-and-burn agriculture was simpler and more primitive than the viticulture of Syria
and the Peloponnese, but yielded a fabulous harvest with less expenditure of labour;
languages, religion, art, education were all unlike each other, but there was no confusion
in this diversity because each fife style was the property of a definite people.</p>

<p>It should not be thought, however, that the degree of ethnic individuality is
determined only by nature. Centuries passed and the relations of ethnoi changed, some
disappearing, others appearing; it is accepted in Soviet ethnography to call that process
ethnogenesis. The rhythms of ethnogenesis are coupled in world history with a pulse of
social development, but the coupling does not mean coincidence, let alone unity. History
is a single process, but its factors are different, and my task, i.e. analysis, is to
single out the phenomena directly inherent in ethnogenesis, and so to clarify what an
ethnos is and what its role in the fife of mankind.</p>

<p>It is necessary, to start with, to agree on the meaning of the terms and the limits of
the investigation. The Greek word <i>ethnos </i>has many meanings in the dictionary, of
which I have chosen one, viz., 'species, breed', implying by that people. There is no
point, for my posing of the theme, in singling out such concepts as tribe or nation,
because I am interested in the common denominator; in other words the general that exists
among Englishmen and among Masai, among ancient Greeks and modern Gypsies. This is the
property of the species <i>Homo sapiens </i>to group together so as to counterpose
themselves and 'theirs' (sometimes close, but often quite remote) to all the rest of the
world. This singling out is characteristic of all epochs and countries: Hellenes and
barbarians, Jews and the uncircumcised, Chinese (people of the Middle Kingdom) and Hu (the
barbarian periphery, Russians included), Muslim Arabs in the time of the first Caliphs and
'infidels'; Catholic Europeans in the Middle Ages (the unity called the 'Christian world')
and 'godless', including Greeks and Russians; 'Orthodox' (in the same period) and
unbaptized, including Catholics; Tuaregs and non-Tuaregs, Gypsies and all other people,
etc. This opposition is a universal phenomenon, which indicates its deep foundation, but
in itself it is only the foam on a deep river, and I have still to bring out its essence.
But the observation already made is enough to attest the complexity of the effect which
can be called ethnic (in the sense 'stock' or 'breed') and which can be taken as an aspect
for constructing an ethnic history of mankind. My task is therefore first of all to find
the cause of the process.</p>

<p>There is an undoubted link between ethnic history and geography, but it cannot exhaust
the whole complexity of the relationship of the diverse phenomena of nature and the
zigzags of the history of ethnoi. Furthermore, the thesis: 'Any attribute by which ethnoi
can be classified is adaptive to a concrete environment' reflects only one aspect of the
process of ethnogenesis. As Hegel wrote: '...the mild Ionic sky certainly contributed much
to the charm of the Homeric poems, yet this alone can produce no Homers'. <a name="ebe1text11"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note11">[+11]</a></p>

<p>However, when an ethnos that has taken shape in a definite region where adaptation to
the terrain has been maximum migrates, it retains many of the original features that
distinguished it from the aboriginal ethnoi. The Spaniards who settled in Mexico, for
example, did not become Indians - Aztecs or Mayas. They created an artificial
microlandscape for themselves - towns and fortified haciendas - and preserved their
culture, both material and spiritual, in spite of the fact that the moist tropics of
Yucatan and the semideserts of Anlhuac were very different from Andalusia and Castile. But
the separation of Mexico from Spain in the nineteenth century was largely the work of the
descendants of Indian tribes that had adopted the Spanish language and Catholicism, but
that were supported by the free tribes of the Comanche who had migrated north of the Rio
Grande.</p>

<p>Let me now draw a first conclusion, which will be the starting point for the further
exposition. The mosaic anthroposphere, which has been constantly changing in historical
time and interacting with the topography of planet Earth, is nothing else than an
ethnosphere. Since mankind has spread everywhere, though unevenly, over the land surface,
and always interacts with Earth's natural environment, but differently, it is sensible to
treat it as one of Earth's envelopes, but with an obligatory correction for ethnic
differences. So I am introducing the term 'ethnosphere' which, like other geographical
phenomena, must have its own patterns of development, different from the biological and
the social. Ethnic patterns are observable in space (ethnography) and in time
(ethnogenesis and the palaeogeography of the anthropogenic landscape).</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Can one trust the historical sources?</strong></font> </i>Yatsunsky,
the author of fine surveys of the geographical thought of the fifteenth to eighteenth
centuries, justly remarked: 'Historical geography does not study the historical ideas of
people of the past but the concrete geography of past centuries'. <a name="ebe1text12"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note12">[+12]</a>
The initial data for this quest obviously have to be sought in the historical works of
past ages, but how? Unfortunately, there are no pointers to a possible method of research.
And here is why.</p>

<p>Historical materials, as sources for the reconstruction of ancient climatic conditions,
have been and are employed very widely. A famous polemic developed on this plane between
Berg <a name="ebe1text13"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note13">[+13]</a> and Grumm-Grzhimailo <a name="ebe1text14"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note14">[+14]</a> on
the desiccation of Central Asia in the historical period. They tried to solve the problem
of the fluctuations of the level of the Caspian Sea in the first millennium A.D.
associated with this question by selecting citations from the works of ancient authors.
Special digests of information from Russian chronicles were made so as to draw conclusions
about the change in Eastern Europe's climate. But the results of the numerous, laborious
studies did not come up to expectations. The information of the sources was sometimes
confirmed, but tests by other ways sometimes refuted them. Hence it follows that the
coincidence of the data obtained with the truth was a matter of chance, which suggested
that the method was defective. In fact the method of simple references to the evidence of
an ancient or mediaeval author leads to a false conclusion, or at best to an inexact one.
And so it should. The chroniclers either mentioned phenomena of nature among others or,
starting from the ideas of the science of their time, treated storms, floods, and droughts
as omens or punishment for sins. In both cases the phenomena were described selectively,
when they came into an author's field of view, and we cannot even guess how many got left
out. One author would draw attention to nature, but another, in the next century, did not;
and it could turn out that rains were mentioned more often in a dry time than in a wet
one. The historical criticism is unable to help here because it is power. less as regards
omissions of events not linked by a causal dependence.</p>

<p>Ancient authors always wrote their works with a definite purpose and, as a rule,
attached exaggerated importance to events that interested them. The degree of exaggeration
or belittling is very difficult to determine, and is not always possible. So Berg
concluded, from historical works, that the conversion of cultivated land into desert was a
consequence of wars. That idea is now taken without criticism; P.K. Kozlov's find, the
dead Tangut city of Yijing-ai known as Hara-Hoto <a name="ebe1text15"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note15">[+15]</a>, is often
cited as an example. This is so significant a point that I shall concentrate attention on
one problem the geographical location of this city and the conditions of its death.</p>

<p>The Tangut kingdom was located in the Ordos and the AlaShan, in places where there are
now sandy deserts. This state, it would seem, was poor and thinly populated, but in fact
it maintained an army of 150 000 horsemen, had a university, an academy, schools, a legal
procedure, and even a trade deficit, because it imported more than it exported. The
deficit was covered in part by gold dust from its Tibetan possessions; the main export was
live cattle, which constituted its wealth.</p>

<p>The city discovered by Kozlov lay in the lower reaches of the Edzin-Gol, in a locality
now uninhabited. The two ox-bow lakes that surround it on the east and west indicate that
there used to be water, but the river changed course to the west and now falls by two arms
into lakes (a salt one - Gashun Nor, and a fresh one - Sogo Nor). Kozlov described the
valley of the Sogo Nor as a freshwater oasis in the desert surrounding it, but noted at
the same time that it could not feed a large population. But the citadel of Hara-Hoto
alone is a square with sides of 400 metres. Around it there are traces of lesser
structures and fragments of ceramics that indicate the existence of handicraft suburbs.
The destruction of the city is often ascribed to the Mongols. In fact Genghis-khan took
the Tangut capital in 1227 and the Mongols brutally made short work of its population. But
the city discovered by Koziov continued to exist still in the fourteenth century, as is
attested by the dates of the many documents found by members of the expedition. Then the
end of the city was linked with the change in the river's course, which was diverted by
the besiegers, according to Torgod folk tradition by means of a dam made of sandbags. The
dam has survived to the present in the form of a wall. So, it seemingly existed, but the
Mongols had nothing to do with it. In the descriptions of the capture of the city of
Urahai (Mongolian) or Heshuicheng (Chinese) there is no such information. And it would
simply have been impossible since the Mongol horsemen were not equipped with the necessary
trenching tool. The death of the city was ascribed to the Mongols by an evil tradition
that began back in the Middle Ages of ascribing everything bad to them. In fact the Tangut
city perished in 1372 and was captured by Chinese troops of the Ming Dynasty, who were
then waging war against the last of the Genghisites, and was laid waste as a base of
Mongols who were threatening China from the west.</p>

<p>But why didn't it revive? The change in the river's course was not the reason, since
the city could have migrated to another tributary of the Edzin-Gol. An answer to that can
be found in Kozlov's book. With the powers of observation characteristic of him, he noted
that the amount of water in the Edzin-Gol had got less, and the lake Sogo Nor had grown
shallower, and overgrown with reeds. The shifting of the river bed to the west had played
a certain role in that, but it alone could not explain why the country had fed a huge
population in the thirteenth century, but had been converted into a sandy desert at the
beginning of the twentieth.</p>

<p>So the blame for the desolation of the cultivated land of Asia does not fall on the
Mongols but on changes of climate which I have described in special works. <a name="ebe1text16"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note16">[+16]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Can we believe the memorials?</strong></font> </i>But
why were Genghis-khan and his sons blamed for the devastation of Asia, while other events
of a much greater scale (for example, the defeat of the Uighurs by the Kyrgyz in A.D.
841-846, or the general extermination of the Kalmycks by the Manchurian emperor Ch'ien
Lung in 1756-1758) <a name="ebe1text17"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note17">[+17]</a> have remained outside historians' field
of view?</p>

<p>The answer has to be sought in historiography rather than in the history of peoples.
Talented books on history are not often written, in any case, and besides do not all come
down to us. In the Near East the age of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries was a
period of the flowering of literature, but the struggle against the Mongol yoke both in
Persia and in Russia then was the most pressing problem, and a host of works was devoted
to it there that have survived to our day. Among them were both talented and brilliant
works, judging by those that have come down to us. They evoked imitations and repetitions,
which increased the total number of works on this question. The extermination of the
Oirats did not find its historian, or he perished in the massacre. Thus, it turned out,
events were not illuminated uniformly and their significance was distorted, since they
were presented, as it were, on different scales. Hence, too, a hypothesis arose that
ascribed the almost total annihilation of the population of the lands conquered by
Genghis-khan, and the complete alteration of the landscape, to his hordes, which by no
means corresponds to the truth. It should be noted that the maximum desiccation did not
occur in countries ravaged by the hordes, but in Uighuria, where they were not at all, and
Jungaria, where no one decided to destroy the grassy steppeland. The historical and
geographical information of the sources is consequently unreliable.</p>

<p>And, finally, it is tempting to consider tremendous historical events, like the
Mongols' campaigns of the thirteenth century, as migrations. The eminent British scholars
Ellsworth Huntington and C.E.P. Brooks, for example, yielded to this temptation. But the
Mongol campaigns were not associated with migrations. The victories were not won by crowds
of nomads but by smallish, beautifully organized mobile detachments that returned to their
native steppes after the campaigns. The numbers on the move were insignificant even for
the thirteenth century. The khans of the Juchid branch, for instance, Batu, Orda, and
Shayban, received by Genghis-khan's will only 4 000 horsemen, i.e. around 20 000 persons,
who were settled over a territory from the Carpathians to the Altai. The real migration of
the Kalmycks in the seventeenth century, on the contrary, remained unnoted by most
historians because it did not have great resonance in works of world history.
Consequently, a more solid knowledge of history is required, in order to tackle the
problem posed, than what is readily derived from summary works, and a more detailed
knowledge of geography than that to which historians or agricultural economists usually
limit themselves. The main point is that it is necessary to extract reliable information
from the subjective perceptions characteristic of many authors of written sources from
Herodotus to our day.</p>

<p>We are well acquainted with the dates and details of battles, peace treaties, palace
revolutions, and great discoveries, but we do not always know how to link these data up
with definite phenomena of nature. The method of comparing the facts of history and
changes of nature only began to be developed in the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Le Roy Ladurie, the historian of climate, has noted that the tendency to reduce booms
and slumps of the economy in the various countries of Europe to periods of increased or
lowered precipitation, cooling or warming, was based on an ignoring of economic and social
crises, whose role was not doubted. He thus considered that the increase in imports of
Baltic (i.e. Russian.-L.G.) grain into the Mediterranean, and reduction of the number of
sheep in Spain in the sixteenth and especially the seventeenth centuries, are more easily
correlated with the destruction inflicted on European countries by the Reformation and the
Counter-Reformation than with insignificant changes in annual temperatures. <a name="ebe1text18"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note18">[+18]</a>
He is right! Suffice it to note that there was a fall in population in that century not
only in Germany, on whose territory the devastating Thirty Years' War (1618-1648) was
fought, but also in Spain, a country that did not suffer ravages (in 1600, 8 000 000, and
in 1700, 7 300 000). But that was due to a large part of the young men having been
mobilized in America or the Netherlands, as a consequence of which there were not enough
working hands in the country to maintain the economy and families.</p>

It is consequently necessary, in his opinion, simply to amass facts dated as accurately
and unambiguously as possible, so as not to encourage contradictory interpretations.</p>

<p>There is no exact method of determining absolute dating in geography. A mistake of a
thousand years is considered quite acceptable in it. It is easy to establish, for example,
that deposits of silt have covered strata of loams, and consequently to note the existence
of flooding, but it is impossible to say when it happened 500 or 5 000 years ago. Pollen
analysis indicates the existence, for example, of xerophilous (drought-tolerant) plants in
a place where moisture-loving ones now grow, but there is no guarantee that the swamping
of a valley occurred because of a shifting of the channel of a near-by river, and not
through a change of climate. Remains of groves have been discovered in the steppes of
Mongolia and Kazakhstan but it is impossible to say from them whether they died out from
desiccation or from being chopped down by people; and even if the latter were
demonstrated, the time of savage treatment of the landscape would still remain unknown.</p>

<p>Perhaps archaeology can help? Memorials of material culture distinctly mark periods of
the flourishing and decline of peoples, and are amenable to quite accurate dating. The
things found in the ground, or old burials, do not tend to mislead researchers or inspire
them to distort the facts. But things are mute, which gives the archaeologists plenty of
scope for imagination. And our contemporaries are also prone to romance and let their
imagination run away with them; and although their way of thinking is very different from
the mediaeval one, there is no certainty that they are any closer to reality. In the
twentieth century we sometimes meet blind faith in the power of archaeological
excavations, based on the truly successful finds in Egypt, Babylonia, India, and even in
the Altai Mts., thanks to which we have been able to discover and investigate forgotten
countries of ancient history. But that is the exception; for the most part the
archaeologist has to be satisfied with shards got from the dust of scorching steppes,
fragments of bones in rifled graves, and remains of walls, the height in one imprint of a
brick. And one must remember, moreover, that the find is an insignificant part of the
lost. It is never known what precisely is lost, but it is a mistake to consider the lost
to be non-existent, and not to make allowances for it, a mistake that leads to obviously
incorrect conclusions. In short, archaeology without history can lead the researcher into
error. Let us try otherwise.</p>

<h4 align="center">Are There Ethnoi?</h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><i>There are no signs for defining an ethnos.</i></strong></font>
According to my suggested definition, the form of existence of the species <i>Homo sapiens</i>
is a collective of individuals opposing themselves to all other collectives. It is more or
less stable, although it arises and disappears in historical time, which constitutes the
problem of ethnogenesis. All these collectives differ more or less from one another,
sometimes in language, sometimes in customs, sometimes in system of ideology, sometimes in
origin, but always in historical fate or destiny. An ethnos is consequently, on the one
hand, a product of history, and on the other is linked, through productive activity or the
economy, with the biocoenosis of the landscape and country in which it was formed.
Consequently an ethnic national group can change this relation, but with that it is
altered beyond recognition, and continuity is only traceable by the scientific method,
with the strictest criticism of sources, because words are deceptive.</p>

<p>Before I go any further, we must agree on the concept 'ethnos', which I have not yet
defined. We do not have a single real attribute for defining an ethnos as such, although
there has never been, and is not, a human being who is unethnic. All the attributes listed
define an ethnos 'sometimes', but their aggregate defines nothing at an. Let us check this
thesis by the negative method.</p>

<p>In the theory of historical materialism the basis of society is recognized as the mode
of production, which develops through socioeconomic formations. That is why
self-development plays the decisive role in it; the influence of erogenous factors,
including natural ones, cannot be basic in the genesis of social progress. The concept
'society' signifies an aggregate of people united by the concrete historical conditions of
material life common to them. The main force in this system of conditions is the mode of
production of material goods. People are united in the course of production, and the
result of this uniting Is social relations, which are formed in one of the five known
formations (primitive communal, slaveowning, feudal, capitalist, and communist).</p>

<p>It is impossible 'to be united in an ethnos', since membership of one ethnos or another
is directly perceived by the subject himself, and the surrounding ones take it as a fact
not subject to doubt. Feeling or sensation consequently underlies the ethnic diagnostic. A
person belongs to his ethnos from infancy. It is sometimes possible to incorporate
strangers, but if that happens on a broad scale it disintegrates the ethnos. An ethnos can
be broken up, but it is preserved in a diasporic state, forming numerous relict forms. The
historical conditions are altered more than once during the fife of an ethnos; conversely,
divergence of ethnoi is often observed during the predominance of one mode of production.
Starting from Marx's idea of the historical process as an interaction of the history of
nature and the history of men, <a name="ebe1text20"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note20">[+20]</a> we can propose a first, most
general division into social stimuli arising in the technosphere, and natural stimuli
constantly operating from the geographical environment. Everyone is not only a member of
some society or other that is at a certain level of development, but is also a physical
body subject to gravitation, and the final link in some biocoenosis, an organism capable
of adaptation and existing at an age determined by the effect of hormones. The same can be
said about the long-living collectives that socially form class states or tribal unions of
various character (social organisms), and in nature form ethnoi (tribes, nationalities,
nations). Their non-coincidence is obvious.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>An ethnos is not a society.</strong></font> </i>But
there is another point of view, in accordance with which</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">an ethnos ... is a socio-historical category, whose genesis and
  development are determined, moreover, not by the biological laws of nature but by the
  specific laws of the development of society. <a name="ebe1text21"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note21">[+21]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>How is that to be understood? According to the theory of historical materialism, the
spontaneous development of the productive forces causes changes in the relations of
production which generates a dialectical process of class formation that are transformed
by processes of class abolition. This is a global phenomenon, a peculiar social form of
the development of matter. But what does that have to do with ethnogenesis? Surely the
appearance of such well-known ethnoi as the French or English did not coincide
chronologically or territorially with the moulding of the feudal formation. Or did these
ethnoi disappear with its collapse and the transition to capitalism? But in that same
France the 'socio-historical category', the Kingdom of France, already embraced, in the
fourteenth century, Celtic Bretons, Basques, Provencals, and Burgundians in addition to
the French; so surely they were ethnoi? Doesn't this fact, one of very many, indicate that
the pedigree definition is one-sided? And so that is grounds for scientific dispute.</p>

<p>Dialectical materialism distinguishes various forms of the motion of matter. The
mechanical, physical, chemical, and biological are natural forms, while the social stands
alone; by virtue of its specific nature it is characteristic only of mankind in all its
manifestations. Every person and collective of people with technique and domesticated
things (tame animals and cultivated plants) is subject to the effect of both social and
natural forms of the motion of matter, which are ceaselessly correlated in time (history)
and space (geography). When we generalize the material in a single complex (historical
geography), amenable to observation and study, we have to examine it in two aspects
-
the social and the natural. In the first we see social organizations (tribal unions,
states, theocracies, political parties, philosophical schools, etc.), in the second,
ethnoi, i.e. collectives of people that arise and break up in a relatively short time but
in each case have an original structure, a unique stereotype of behaviour, and its own
rhythm of development, existing within the limit of homeostasis.</p>

<p>It is accepted, of course, to call classes, for example, sometimes juridically
registered in estates or castes, socio-historical categories. In pre-class society tribal
or gentile unions, for example the Celts' clans, were their analogue. In its broad sense
'social category' can be extended to stable institutions, the state, for example, or
church organization, the <i>polis </i>(in Hellas), or the fief. But everyone who knows
history is aware that such categories only coincide with the boundaries of ethnoi in very
rare cases, i.e. there is no direct link here. And, what is more, the economy, which
belongs completely to the social form of the motion of matter, demolishes national
boundaries. With the existence of a common European market, similar technique, similarity
of education in the various countries, and widespread study of related languages, it might
seen, that ethnic differences would be wiped out in twentieth-century Europe. But are they
in fact? The Irish broke away from Great Britain and spared no efforts to study their
ancient, almost forgotten language. Scotland and Catalonia lay claims to autonomy although
they had hardly considered themselves oppressed for the past 300 years. In Belgium
Flemings and Walloons, who lived in harmony until recently, have suddenly begun a violent
struggle that has come to street fights between students of the two ethnoi. And since only
chance coincidence of social and ethnic peaks and slumps were also observed in antiquity,
it is obvious that we are observing an interference of two lines of development or, in the
language of mathematics, of two independent variables. This can only be ignored with a
very strong desire to do so.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Language.</strong></font> </i>Let us try to discover
the nature of the perceptible manifestation of the existence of ethnoi, the phenomenon of
the counterposing of itself to all others, i.e. the 'we' and the 'not us'. What gives rise
to this opposition and feeds it? Not unity of language, because there are many bilingual
and trilingual ethnoi and on the contrary different ethnoi that speak one language. The
French, for instance, speak four languages - French , Celtic, Basque, and Provencal, which
does not prevent their present ethnic unity in spite of the history of the unification, or
rather the Parisian kings' conquest of France from the Rhine to the Pyrenees, having been
quite bloody. On the other hand, the Mexicans, Peruvians, and Argentines speak Spanish,
but are not Spaniards. For some reason torrents of blood were spilled at the beginning of
the nineteenth century only in order for war-torn Latin America to fall into the hands of
trading companies of Great Britain and the USA. The Englishmen of Northumberland speak a
language close to Norwegian because they are the descendants of Vikings who settled in
England; and until recently the Irish knew only English but did not become English.
Several different peoples speak Arabic; for many Uzbeks their mother tongue is Tajik, and
so on. In addition there are group languages, like French in England in the twelfth and
thirteenth centuries, Greek in Parthia in the second and first centuries B.C., Arabic in
Persia from the seventh to eleventh centuries A.D., and so on. Since the integrity of the
ethnic national group was not disrupted, one must conclude that it is not a matter of
language.</p>

<p>Furthermore, linguistic diversity often finds practical application, the practice
bringing people speaking different languages closer together. During the U.S.- Japanese
war in the Pacific, for example, the Japanese succeeded so well in decoding American radio
transmissions that the Americans lost the possibility of transmitting secret information
by radio. But they found a clever, unexpected way out, by teaching the Morse code to
called-up Indians. An Apache transmitted to a Navajo in Athabaskan, an Assiniboin to a
Sioux in Dakota, and the receiver translated the text into English. The Japanese broke the
code but were helpless in face of the texts. Military service often brings people
together; the Indians who returned home remained friends with their paleface war comrades.
It did not, however, assimilate the Indians; the command, moreover, valued precisely their
ethnic features, including bilingualism. So, although language may serve as an indicator
of ethnic community in separate cases, it is not the cause of it.</p>

<p>The Weps, Udmurts, Karelians, and Chuvash, let us note, still speak their our languages
at home, but study Russian in school, and on quitting their villages are practically
indistinguishable from Russians. Their knowledge of their native language does not in the
least prevent them from working on a common footing.</p>

<p>Finally, the Ottoman Turks! In the thirteenth century the Turkmenian chieftain
Orthogrul, escaping from the Mongols, led around 500 horsemen and their families into Asia
Minor. The sultan of Iconium settled the arrivals in Brussa, on the border with Nicaea, to
wage a border war with the 'infidel' Greeks. Under the first sultans volunteer ghazi
gathered in Brussa from all over the Near East, attracted by the allure of booty and land
for settlement; they constituted cavalry, <i>spahis. </i>The conquest of Bulgaria and
Macedonia in the fourteenth century enabled the Turkish sultans to organize infantry from
Christian boys, who were torn from their families, converted to Islam, trained for
warfare, and given the status of guards - the 'new troops' (janissaries). In the fifteenth
century a navy was created, manned by all the adventurists of the coasts of the
Mediterranean. In the sixteenth century light cavalry <i>(akinji) </i>were added, formed
from emigrants from conquered Diarbekr, Iraq, and Kurdistan. French renegades became
diplomats, and Greeks, Armenians, and Jews financiers and economists. These people bought
wives in the slave markets (Poles, Ukrainians, Germans, Italians, Georgians, Greeks,
Berbers, Negroes, etc.). These women were the mothers and grandmothers of the Turkish
troops. During the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, the Turks were an ethnos, but the
young soldier received orders in Turkish, talked with his mother in Polish, and his
grandmother in Italian, traded in the bazaar in Greek, read verses in Persian, and prayed
in Arabic. But he was an 'Ottoman' because he behaved as an Ottoman<i> </i>did, a brave,
pious warrior of Islam.</p>

<p>The numerous European renegades broke down this unity in the nineteenth century, and
formed the Young Turks in Paris. In the twentieth century the Ottoman Empire fell, and the
ethnos broke up - people passed into other ethnoi. The descendants of the Seljuks raised a
new Turkey from the depths of Asia Minor, and the remnants of the Ottomans lived out their
remaining days in the alleys of Istanbul. So, a religious community, not a linguistic one,
united the Ottoman ethnos for 600 years.</p>

<p>Ideology and culture are sometimes also attributes, but not necessary ones. Only an
Orthodox Christian could be a Byzantine, for example, and all Orthodox were considered
subjects of the Constantinople emperor, and perceived as 'ours'. But that was disrupted as
soon as the baptized Bulgars started war with the Greeks, while Rus, having adopted
Orthodoxy, did not dream of submitting to Czargrad. The principle of like-mindedness was
also proclaimed by the Caliphs, the successors of Muhammed, but it did not withstand the
rivalry of living reality - ethnoi again arose within the unity of Islam. On the other
hand, preaching sometimes unites a group of people, which becomes an ethnos-the Sikhs in
northwest India, for example, and the Ottoman Turks (see above). But in the Ottoman Empire
there were Sunni Muslims, subjects of the Sultan, Arabs, and Crimean Tatars, who did not,
however, consider themselves Turks. Even linguistic closeness to the Ottomans played no
role for the Tatars. So faith, too, is not a common attribute of ethnicity.</p>

<p>A clear example of the confessional self-awareness of an ethnos is the Sikhs, a sect of
Indian origin. The caste system established in India was considered obligatory for all
Hindus. It was a special structure of the ethnos. Being a Hindu meant being a member of a
definite caste. It was not a political unity, but the stereotype of behaviour was firmly
maintained, even quite brutally. Each caste had the right to a certain type of occupation,
and those on whom military service was settled were few. That made it possible for Afghan
Muslims to master India and jeer at the defenseless population, the inhabitants of Punjab
suffering most. In the sixteenth century a teaching appeared there that at first
proclaimed non-resistance to evil, but later set an aim of war against Muslims. The caste
system was abolished, which distinguished the Sikhs (the name of devotees of the new
faith) from Hindus. They isolated themselves from the Indian community by endogamy,
developed their own stereotype of behaviour, and established a structure of their own
community. According to the principle I have adopted, the Sikhs should be regarded as a
rising ethnos counterposed to Hindus. And so they perceive themselves. The religious
conception has become a symbol for them, and for us an indicator of ethnic divergence.</p>

<p>The teaching of the Sikhs cannot be considered just a doctrine, because if anyone in
Moscow were to embrace this religion fully he would not become a Sikh, and they would not
consider him one of them. The Sikhs became an ethnos on the basis of religion, the Mongols
on the basis of kinship, the Swiss through a successful war against Austrian feudalists,
who welded together a country where four languages were spoken. Ethnoi are formed by
various means, and our task is to find the common pattern in that.</p>

<p>Most major peoples have several ethnographic types that constitute a harmonious system
but that differ very much from one another both in time and in social structure. Compare
seventeenth century Moscow with its boyar hats and beards, when women spun behind mica
windows, or eighteenth-century Moscow when magnates in wigs and camisoles took their wives
to balls, and nineteenth-century Moscow when bearded nihilist students educated young
ladies from all estates; and add the decedents of the early twentieth century. Comparing
them all with our age, knowing that they are one and the same ethnos, we see that
ethnography could lead the investigator without a knowledge of history into error. No less
indicative is a spatial cross-section for one year, say 1869. White Sea Russians,
Petersburg workers, Transvolga Old Believers, Siberian gold prospectors, peasants of the
forest provinces and peasants of the steppes, the Don and Ural Cossacks were outwardly
quite unlike one another, but that did not disrupt the folk unity, while the closeness of
the everyday life of the Greben Cossacks and the Chechens did not unite them.</p>

<p>Strange as it may be, the point of view put forward here has met active resistance
precisely where it should attract attention. Kozlov and Pokshishevsky, whose paper I cited
above, have opposed their view to mine both on the relationship of ethnography and
geography and on the history of the question, i.e. on historiography. While not desiring
to polemize, I nevertheless cannot ignore another conception that lays claims (without
grounds) to canonicity. That would be academically incorrect.</p>

<p>These scholars represent the formation of ethnography as a science as follows. Up to
the middle of the nineteenth century geography and ethnography developed together, but
ethnography later split into socio-historical and geographical trends. Lewis Morgan, J.J.
Bachofen, E.B. Tylor, Sir James Frazer, and L.Ya. Sternberg belonged to the first trend,
and Friedrich Ratzel, L.D. Sinitsky, and A.A. Coubert and the French school of 'human
geography' to the second. There is a substantial defect in the classification proposed,
which reduces it essentially to nought. The members of the 'trends' were interested in
different subjects and devoted their attention to different themes. And that being the
case, it is unjustified to counterpose them. For when Ratzel tried to substantiate the
geographical character of ethnographic division into districts he by no means disputed the
conception of animism, sympathetic magic, or ritual murder of a priest, i.e. the subjects
to which Frazer devoted his <i>Golden Bough. </i>But it was to the existence of versatile
scholars' diverse interests that authors ascribed the separation of ethnography from
geography, and its rebirth as a social science. There was a certain confusion in that
fraught with sorry consequences. Any science develops by broadening its range of
investigation, and not by a simple change of thematic. Consequently, when historical
aspects were added to the achievements of geographical ethnography, that was progress of
the science, but when some subjects were replaced by others that was marking time, which
is always extremely damaging.</p>

<p>Equally, one must not replace ethnography by a theory about 'economic-cultural types'
characteristic of peoples that are approximately at an identical level of socioeconomic
development and living in similar natural geographical conditions (for example, the type
of 'Arctic marine-mammal hunters', 'herdsmen of the and steppes', and so on). <a name="ebe1text22"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note22">[+22]</a>
This trend is fruitful for paleo-economic geography, but does not and cannot have any
relation to ethnography - there are, for example, reindeer Chukchi i.e. pastoralists, and
Chukchi hunters of marine mammals. According to the classification proposed they should be
put into different groups, although they are one ethnos. And surely the Russian peasants
of Moscovy, the White Sea Russians (Pomors), and Siberian sable hunters are one ethnos.
And there is indeed no end of examples.</p>

<p>It, is also incorrect to equate ethnos with biological taxonomic units, i.e. races or
populations. Races differ from one another in physical attributes that have no essential
significance for man's life activity. <a name="ebe1text23"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note23">[+23]</a> A population is an
aggregate of individuals peopling a definite territory, in which they freely cross-breed,
and are separated from neighboring populations by isolation of some sort. An ethnos, in my
understanding, is a collective of individuals that has a unique inner structure and an
original stereotype of behaviour, both components being dynamic. Consequently an ethnos is
an elementary phenomenon that is not reducible to either sociological biological, or
geographical phenomena.</p>

<p>Reduction of ethnogenesis to 'linguistic-cultural processes' distorts reality, removing
the complexity of ethnic history, which Bromley pointed out when he proposed introducing
the supplementary terms 'ethnikos' and 'eso' (ethno-social organization) in order to
clarify the problem. <a name="ebe1text24"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note24">[+24]</a> I believe one can be not satisfied
with his solution, but it is incorrect to ignore it altogether.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Descent from a single ancestor.</strong></font> </i>In
ancient times such descent was considered obligatory for an ethnos. Often an animal, which
was not always a totem, figured as the ancestor. For the Turks and the Romans it was a
she-wolf wet-nurse; for the Uighurs a wolf that fertilized a queen; for the Tibetans an
ape and a female rakshas (forest demon). But usually it was a man whose image was
distorted beyond recognition by legend: Abraham, the ancestor of the Jews, his son
Ismail,
the ancestor of the Arabs, Cadmus, the founder of Thebes and initiator of the
Beotians,
and so on.</p>

<p>Strange as it may seem, these archaic views have not died out; only in our time we try
to put some ancient tribe in the place of a person, as the ancestors of an existing
ethnos. But that, too, is incorrect. As there is no person who has only a father or a
mother, so there is no ethnos that had not been produced by various ancestors, And one
should not confuse ethnoi with races, as is often done, but without justification. The
grounds for temptation is the preconceived idea that 'the processes of racial origin (like
the processes of ethnogenesis.- L. G.) probably developed in certain areas of the world
and were governed by the specific nature of the natural environment,' <a name="ebe1text25"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note25">[+25]</a> i.e. by the climate, flora, and fauna of geographical zones.</p>

<p>There is an impermissible substitution of an object here, i.e. the initial race is
arbitrarily equated with ethnos. Let us examine this.</p>

<p>During the Upper Paleolithic, when sub-arctic conditions prevailed in Europe, with a
very arid climate, the valley of the Rhone was settled by the Grimaldi Negroid race, while
the tropical forests of Africa were inhabited by the Khoisan race, which combined
Mongoloid and Negroid features. This race was ancient; its origin is unclear, but there
are no grounds for considering it a hybrid. The Negroid Bantu pushed the Khoisan to the
extreme south of Africa in a quite historical period, beginning in the first century A.D.
up to the nineteenth century, when the Bechauna drove the Bushmen into the Kalahari
Desert. Negroid features did not arise at all in equatorial America, although the natural
conditions were similar to the African.</p>

<p>The arid zone of Eurasia was peopled by Europeoids of the Cromagnon type and by
Mongoloids, but that did not lead to a wiping out of racial features. In Tibet the
Mongoloid Bod (Bodyul) were neighbors of the Europeoid Dardi and Pamirtsy, and in the
Himalayas the Gurkhas of the Patani. But the similarity of natural environment did not
influence the racial character. In short, one must recognize that the functional
connection of anthropological differences among various populations and the geographical
conditions of the areas peopled by them is not clear. Furthermore, there is no certainty
that there is one in general in nature, the more so that the idea runs counter to the
achievements of modern paleoanthropology, which bases racial classification not on zones
of latitude but by meridional regions (Atlantic, to which Europeoids and African Negroids
are assigned; and Pacific, to which the Mongoloids of East Asia and America belong). This
point of view rules out the effect of natural conditions on the origin of races because
both groups took shape in various climatic zones.</p>

<p>Ethnoi are always linked, on the contrary, with natural conditions, through active
economic activity, which is manifested in two directions, viz., adaptation to the terrain,
and of the latter to the ethnos. In both cases, however, we come up against an ethnos as a
really existing phenomenon, although the reason for its origin is not clear.</p>

<p>It is also not necessary to reduce the whole diversity of my theme to some one thing.
It is better simply to establish the role of certain factors. The terrain, for example,
determines an ethnic collective's possibilities during its rise, but a newly born ethnos
alters the terrain in accordance with its requirements. Such mutual adaptation is only
possible when a rising ethnos is full of strength and is seeking to apply it. Later,
however, it becomes used to the established situation, which becomes near and dear to its
descendants. Denial of that leads inevitably to a conclusion that peoples have no
homeland, understood here as a combination of topographical elements dear to all hearts.
Hardly anyone will agree with that.</p>

<p>That alone indicates that ethnogenesis is not a social process, because spontaneous
development of the sociosphere only interacts with natural phenomena, but is not a product
of them. But it is precisely because ethnogenesis is a process, and a directly observed
ethnos is a phase of ethnogenesis, and consequently an unstable system, that any
comparison of ethnoi with anthropological races is ruled out, and so with any racial
theories. In fact, the principle of anthropological classification is similarity, and the
people who comprise an ethnos are diverse.</p>

<p>Two or more components always operate during ethnogenesis. The crossing of various
ethnoi sometimes yields a new stable form, but sometimes leads to degeneration. A mixture
of Slavs, Ugrians, Alans, and Turks merged into the Great Russian nationality, while the
Mongolo-Chinese and Manchurian-Chinese mixtures that often took shape along the line of
the Chinese Great Wall over the last two thousand years proved unstable and disappeared
and did not form independent ethnic units.</p>

<p>Central Asia was inhabited by Sogdians in the seventh century A.D., and the term
'Tajik' already meant 'Arab' in the eighth century, i.e. warriors of the Caliph. Nasr ibn
Sayyar, when suppressing a rising of Sogdians in A.D. 733, was forced to recruit Khorassan
Persians, who had already adopted Islam, to his depleted forces. He picked many of them,
so that Persian began to predominate in his Arab army. After his victory, when the Sogdian
men were slaughtered, and the children were sold into slavery, but the beautiful women and
flourishing gardens were shared out among the victors, a Persian-speaking population
developed in Sogdiana and Bukhara, that resembled the Khorassians. But in 1510 the fates
of Iran and Central Asia diverged. The Turk Ismail Safevi, a zealous Shiite, conquered
Iran and converted the Persians to Shi'ism. But Central Asia fell to Sunni Uzbeks, and the
Persian-speaking population retained the old name 'Tajik' which, before the fall of the
Bukharan dynasty of the Mangyts in 1918, had no significance attached to it. When the
Uzbek and Tajik Republics were formed m the old Turkestan Territory, the descendants of
the Khorassan Persians, the eighth-century conquerors, who lived in Bukhara and Samarkand,
were counted as Uzbeks in the census, and the descendants of the Turks, the conquerors of
the eleventh and sixteenth centuries, living in Dushanbe and Shakhrisabz, as Tajiks. They
knew both languages from childhood, were Muslims, and were indifferent to how they were
recorded. Over the past 40 years the position has altered; Tajiks and Uzbeks have been
formed as socialist nations, but how were they to be regarded before then, when religious
affiliation determined ethnic affiliation (Muslims and Kafirs) and there were no clans
among Tajiks? For both ethnic substrata Turks and Iranians --were
'imported' ethnoi in Central Asia a thousand years ago, quite a long enough period for
adaptation. There is obviously a certain pattern here that needs to be brought out and
described. But clearly community of origin cannot be the indicator for determination of an
ethnos. It is a myth inherited by our consciousness from the primitive science of
primitive society.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Ethnos as an illusion.</strong></font> </i>But perhaps
'ethnos' is simply a social category that takes shape with the formation of a society. <a name="ebe1text26"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note26">[+26]</a> Then 'ethnos' is an illusory value and ethnography a
meaningless past-time, since it is simpler to study social conditions directly. That point
of view is mistaken, however, which becomes obvious when speculation is replaced by
observations of natural processes accessible to a thoughtful person. Let me clarify this
from real examples. Celtic Bretons and Iberian Gascons live in France. In the forests of
the Vendйe and on the slopes of the Pyrenees they dress in their own costumes, speak
their own language, and distinguish themselves distinctly in their homeland from the
French. But can one say of Marshal Murat or Lannes that they were Basques and not French?
Or about D'Artagnan, both as a historical personage and the hero of Dumas' novel? Can we
not consider the Breton nobleman Chateaubriand and Gilles de Retz, the companion of Joan
of Arc, Frenchmen? Wasn't the Irishman Oscar Wilde not an English writer? The famous
Orientalist Chokan Valikhanov said of himself that he considered himself equally Russian
and Kazakh. There is any number of such examples, but they all show that the ethnic
affiliation discoverable in peoples' consciousness is not a product of consciousness
itself. It evidently reflects some aspect or other of the person, much deeper, and
external as regards consciousness, by which I understand a form of higher nervous
activity. But in other cases, ethnoi for some reason manifest immense resistance to the
effects of their surroundings and do not assimilate.</p>

<p>The Gypsies have now been separated from their society and India for a thousand years,
have lost their link with their native land, and nevertheless have not merged with the
Spaniards, or the French, or the Czechs, or the Mongols. They did not adopt the feudal
institutions of the societies of Europe, remaining an outsider group in all the countries
where they lived. The Iroquois still live as a tiny ethnic group (totaling 20 000
persons), surrounded by hypertrophied capitalism, but do not adopt the 'American way of
life'. In the Mongolian People's Republic there are Turkic ethnoi (Soyots or
Uranhaitsy,
Kazakhs, etc.), but in spite of a similarity of the 'material and spiritual development of
society', they have not merged with the Mongols, but constitute independent
ethnoi. And
conversely, French settled in Canada in the eighteenth century and still retain their
ethnic face. Jews lived in Salonika as an endogamous group more than 400 years after their
expulsion from Spain, but according to the data of 1918 they were more like Arabs than
their neighbors the Greeks. Exactly the same way Germans from Hungary outwardly resembled
their confrйres in Germany, and Gypsies Hindus. Selection alters the correlation of
attributes slowly, and mutations, we know, are rare. Any nationality living in a terrain
customary for it is therefore almost in a state of equilibrium.</p>

<p>But one must not think that a change of conditions of existence never influences an
ethnos. Sometimes it exerts such a strong impact that new attributes are formed, and new
ethnic variants that are more or less stable. We must therefore examine how these
processes come about and why they yield different results.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Between West and East.</strong></font> </i>When we
acquaint ourselves with the cultures of the Mediterranean, we rind ourselves in an
environment of accustomed concepts and values. Religion signifies belief in God, the state
is a territory with a definite order and authority, countries have names, peoples an
ethnic affiliation, and rivers and lakes are in definite places.</p>

<p>Only the customary titles 'West' and 'East' do not behave quite geographically. Morocco
is considered 'East' and Hungary and Poland 'West'. But everyone manages to adapt to this
convention, and there is no confusion of the concepts. Non-specialists' familiarity with
the subject as a consequence of reading fiction, and the availability of living tradition,
are very conducive to this.</p>

<p>But as soon as we cross the mountain passes that divide Central and Eastern Asia, we
come into a world of another system of reckoning. Here we meet religions that deny the
existence not only of a divinity but also of the world around us. Regimes and social
structures prove to contradict the principle of the state and authority. We find ethnoi in
nameless countries without a community of language and economy, and sometimes even of
territory, while rivers and lakes will migrate like pastoralists. The tribes that we are
accustomed to consider nomads prove to be settled, and the strength of armies will not
depend on their numbers. Only the patterns of ethnogenesis remain unchanged.</p>

<p>Other material calls for another approach and consequently another scale of
investigation. Otherwise it will remain incomprehensible and my book will become
unnecessary for the reader. That is to say, the reader accustomed to European terms. He
knows what a 'king' is, and a 'count' or 'earl', a 'chancellor', and a 'bourgeois
commune'.<i> </i>But in the East of Oecumene there were not equivalent terms. A 'khaghan'
was not a king or an emperor, but a military chieftain elected for life who combined with
it the performance of rituals of honoring ancestors. But can we imagine Richard the
Lion-Hearted saying a funerary mass for Henry II, whom he drove to heart failure? And even
that members of the Gascon and English nobility were present at this mass? Indeed, it is
nonsense! But in the east of the Great Steppes, he would have been obliged to do so,
otherwise he would have been killed.</p>

<p>Such appellations as 'Chinese' or 'Hindus' are not equivalent to 'French' or 'Germans'
but to West Europeans as a whole, because they are systems of ethnoi but united on other
principles of culture. Hindus are linked by a system of castes, and Chinese by
hieroglyphic writing and an education connected with it. As soon as a native of Hindustan
was converted to Muhammedanism, he ceased to be a Hindu since he became an outcast or
renegade for his fellow-countrymen and fell into the category of untouchables. And a
Chinese living among barbarians according to their customs, was treated, according to
Confucius, as a barbarian. But a foreigner who observed Chinese etiquette was regarded as
a Chinese.</p>

<p>In order to compare the ethnoi of East and West we have to find a proper correlation
with an equal scale of division. For that purpose I shall study the properties of an
ethnos as a natural phenomenon characteristic of all countries and ages.</p>

<p>To achieve this purpose one must be very attentive to ancient traditional information
about the world, and not to reject it in advance because it does not correspond to our
modern notions and ideas. We constantly forget that people who lived several thousand
years ago had the same consciousness, capacities, and aspiration for the truth and
knowledge as modern people. Treatises that have come down to us from the various peoples
of various times testify to that.</p>

<p>The ordinary approach is not suitable for understanding the history and culture of
Eastern Asia. When we study the history of Europe we can divide it up --
into the history of France, Germany, England, etc., or ancient history, mediaeval, and
modern. Then, studying the history, say, of Rome, we are interested in neighboring peoples
only insofar as Rome clashed with them. For Western countries such an approach is
justified by the results obtained, but when we study Central Asia by this means we do not
get satisfactory results. The reason lies deep; it is that the Asian and European
understanding of the term 'people' ('folk') is different. In Asia itself ethnic unity is
perceived differently, and even if I take off the Levant, and India with Indo-China, as
without direct relation to my theme, there remain all the same three different
understandings, the Chinese, Iranian, and nomadic. The last-named, moreover, varies
particularly strongly with the epoch.</p>

<p>In Europe an ethnonym is a stable concept; in Central Asia it is more or less fluid; in
China it is absorbent, and in Iran exclusive. In other words, in order to be considered a
Chinese in China, a person had to adopt the fundamentals of Chinese morality, education,
and rules of behaviour. Origin was not taken into account, nor language, because the
Chinese spoke different languages in antiquity. It is therefore clear that China
inevitably expanded, swallowing and absorbing small peoples and tribes. In Iran, on the
contrary, a Persian had to be born one, but above all, in addition, had to honour Ahura
Mazda and hate Ahriman. Without that it was impossible to be an 'Aryan'. The mediaeval
(Sassanid) Persians did not think it even possible to include anyone in their ranks since
they called themselves 'well-born' or 'noble' <i>(nondoron), </i>and others did not belong
to that number. As a result, the number of the people steadily fell. It is difficult to
guess at the Parthian conception, but it seemingly differed from the Persian only in being
rather broader.</p>

<p>With the Hunni it was necessary, in order to be considered one, to be a member of a
clan, but a clan could only be joined through marriage or by the command of a shanyui, by
which a person became a member of a clan. The heirs of the Hunni, the Tyrians, began to
incorporate whole tribes. Mixed tribal alliances arose on the basis of acceptance, for
example Kazakhs, Yakuts, etc. Among the Mongols, very close in general to the Turks and
Hunni, the horde was given predominance, i.e. a group of people united by discipline and
leadership. Neither origin nor language, nor religious belief was required for that, but
only courage and readiness to submit. The names of the hordes were clearly not ethnonyms,
but with the existence of hordes ethnonyms fell out of use in general since there was no
need for them; the concept 'people' coincided with that of 'state'.</p>

<p>In that connection we have firmly to remember that the concept 'state' differs in all
the cases mentioned above, and is not intertranslatable. The Chinese 'guo' is represented
by a hieroglyph, viz., an enclosure and a man with a spear. That does not, by any means,
correspond to the English 'state' or the French 'йtat', or even the Latin 'imperium' and
'respublica'. It is also remote in content from the Iranian 'shahr' or the above-mentioned
term 'horde'. The nuances of the difference often prove more significant than the elements
of similarity, and that determines the behaviour of the figures of history. What seems
monstrous to a European is natural for a Mongol, and vice versa. </p>

<p>We cannot help regretting, of course, the widespread idea that all state forms, social
institutions, ethnic norms, and even manners of exposition not like the European, are
simply backward, imperfect, and defective. Banal Eurocentrism is sufficient for Philistine
perception but not suitable for scientific comprehension of the diversity of the observed
phenomena. For from the standpoint of a Chinese or an Arab West Europeans seem to be
defective. And that is also incorrect, untrue and unpromising for history. We obviously
have to find a system of reckoning by which all observations will be made with an equal
degree of accuracy. Only such an approach will make it possible to compare dissimilar
phenomena and so yield reliable conclusions.</p>

<p>In the West countries are distinguished by name, but in the East?</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>A country and people without a name.</strong></font> </i>Between
the eastern boundary of the Muslim world and the north-western outskirts of the Middle
Kingdom which we call China, lies a country that has no definite name. That is all the
more strange since its geographical frontiers are very exactly delineated, the physical
and climatic conditions within it are original and unique, the population numerous, and
long concerned with culture. This country was very well known to Chinese, Greek, and Arab
geographers; it was visited by Russian and West European travelers; archaeological
excavations have been carried out in it many times; and everyone called it descriptively
someway or other, but it did not have a name of its own. We therefore only know where it
was located.</p>

<p>Two mountain ranges stretch eastward from the Pamirs -- the Kunlun
Shan, to the south of which lies Tibet, and the Tien Shan. Between these ranges lies a
sandy desert, the Takla-Makan, intersected by the river Tarim. This river has neither
source nor mouth. Its beginning is taken to be the 'Aral', i.e. the 'island' between the
branches of three rivers, the Yarkand, the Aksu, and the Khotan. Its end is sometimes lost
in the sands, sometimes gets to the lake Karaburunkul and sometimes fills Lop Nor, a lake
that constantly changes place. <a name="ebe1text27"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note27">[+27]</a> In this strange country the
rivers and lakes wander, and people huddle in the mountain foothills. Fresh brooks flow
down from the mountains, but then and there disappear under heaps of scree and come out on
the surface at a considerable distance from the ridges, There are oases there; then the
rivers again disappear, this time into the sands. In this very continental country there
is a very deep depression, the bottom of which lies 154 meters below sea level, and in
this depression there is an ancient cultural center, the Turfan oasis. How were sciences
and the arts studied there in a summer heat as high as 48╟C and winter frosts as low as
-37╟C, in the unbelievable dryness of the autumn air and the strong spring winds?! Yet
they were, and with no little success.</p>

<p>The ancient population of this country had no name for itself. It is accepted now to
call these people Tocharians, but that is not an ethnonym, but a Tibetan sobriquet
--
<i>tha gar, </i>which means 'white head' (blond). The inhabitants of the various oases
spoke various languages of the Indo-European group, including even a West Aryan one unlike
those known in Europe. In the south-west of the country, in the foothills of the Kunlun
Shan, roamed Tibetan tribes that were in close contact with the inhabitants of Khotan and
Yarkand, but did not mix with them. In the early centuries A.D. Sakas penetrated this
country from the west, who settled south of Kashgar as far as Khotan, and Chinese
emigrants escaping the terrors of civil wars. The Chinese built themselves a colony
Gaochang, in the Turfan oasis, which lasted until the ninth century A.D. and disappeared
without trace.</p>

<p>As you will see, it is impossible to choose a name for this country by ethnonym, but
this was a cultured population which organized an economy that must be considered the best
in the ancient world.</p>

<p>The nature of the oases of Central Asia was brought into harmony with the needs of man.
The Turfan people assimilated the Iranian system of underground water supply, <i>keriz</i>,
thanks to which the irrigated area fed a big population. Two harvests a year were
gathered. Turfan grapes can rightly be considered the best in the world; there were
melons, watermelons, and apricots from spring to late autumn; the sowings of long-fiber
cotton were protected from the winds by Lombardy poplars and mulberry trees. And around
was a stony desert of fragments of disintegrated rocks, shingle, and boulders, through
which neither tree nor shrub penetrated. This was a reliable defense of the oasis against
big armies. It was very difficult to send foot soldiers across the desert, because they
had to carry not only food with them, but also water, which greatly increased the baggage
train. And raids of the nomads' light cavalry were not terrible for the fortress walls.</p>

<p>A second large center of this country, Karashahr, lay in the hills around the
freshwater lake Baghrash-kul. This town 'has rich lands... abounds in fish... It is well
fortified by nature and is easily defended.' <a name="ebe1text28"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note28">[+28]</a> From
Baghr-ash-kul flows the Konche-darya, which feeds Lop Nor. The full-flowing Tarim river,
bordered by groves of poplars, tamarisks, sea buckhorn, and tall reeds that give cover to
deer and wild boars, can be reached along its banks without suffering thirst.</p>

<p>The old ideology of the settled dwellers of this country was Buddhism in the Hinayana
form ('Lesser Way' or 'Lesser Vehicle', i.e. the most orthodox teaching of the Buddha
without admixtures), which it is impossible to call a religion. The Hinayanists deny god,
putting the moral law of karma (causal succession) in his place. A Buddha is a man who had
achieved perfection and is an example for anybody wishing to liberate himself from
sufferings and rebirths through the achievement of Nirvana, the state of absolute peace.
Only a purposeful person or <i>arhat </i>(holy man) could achieve it, without depending
either on divine mercy or on outside help.</p>

<p>It goes without saying that achieving the 'path of perfection' is the affair of the
few. But what are the rest to do? They simply concerned themselves with everyday affairs,
respected arhats, listened to sermons in their spare time, and hoped that they themselves
might, in future rebirths, become holy ascetics. But we have already seen, by way of other
examples, how insignificantly dogmas influence the ethnic stereotype of behaviour. The
arhats, merchants, soldiers, and farmers of Turfan, Karashahr, and Kucha constituted a
single system for which Hinayana Buddhism was only a coloring.</p>

<p>The coloring of an object plays its role, however, sometimes an essential one. The
Hinayana community lasted until the fifteenth century, but the Mahayana, also a Buddhist
doctrine, but a vague, complicated one of different character, which spread in Yarkand and
Khotan, obviously not accidentally, had already given way to Islam in the eleventh
century.</p>

<p>The Uighurs who arrived in Turfan professed Manichaeanism, but seemingly as formally as
the Turfanites professed Buddhism. Manichaeanism had already disappeared as an independent
confession before the twelfth century, but Manichaean ideas passed into certain Buddhist
philosophical currents, and into Nestorianism which made a victorious march throughout
Central Asia in the eleventh century. And in those centuries the inhabitants of Turfan,
Karashahr, and Kucha began to call themselves Uighurs.</p>

<p>The Nestorians in Uighuria got along with the Buddhists in spite of their inherent
intolerance. Christianity was seemingly welcome to people of a religious mentality remote
from the atheistic abstractions of Hinayana. The merchants also became Christians, because
the Buddhist doctrine forbade 'those who have taken the path' to touch gold, silver, and
women. Religious people who were actively involved in economic life were therefore
compelled to seek a faith that did not prevent them from living and working. One can
consequently conclude that convenient ecological niches were found for both ideological
systems.</p>

<p>The wealth of this country was mainly based on a favorable geographical position. Two
caravan routes passed across it: one north of the Tien Shan and the other south of them.
Chinese silk flowed by these routes to Provence, and luxury articles of France and
Byzantium to China. The caravaners rested in the oases from the arduous desert crossings,
and fattened their camels and horses. In that connection the local women widely practiced
the first oldest profession, while the husbands permitted their wives these earnings, part
of which went into their pockets. The Uighurs were so accustomed to this that even when,
thanks to an alliance with Mongols, Uighuria became fabulously rich, its inhabitants
begged the Mongol khan not to forbid their wives to entertain travellers. <a name="ebe1text29"></a><a href="ebe1.htm#ebe1note29">[+29]</a></p>

<p>This custom, or more correctly element of the ethnic stereotype of behaviour, proved
more stable than language, religion, political system, and own name. The stereotype of
behaviour developed as an adaptive attribute, i.e. as a mode of adaptation of the ethnos
to its geographical environment. The names changed here more often than the ethnoi bearing
them, the change of ethnonyms being explained by the political climate.</p>

<p>The rich, numerous population of these fertile oases could, without difficulty, feed
the warlike nomads, the more so that the Uighurs, and later the Mongols, took on
themselves the defense of their subjects against foreign enemies. For three hundred years
the Uighurs mixed with the aborigines, but forced them to change from the Tocharian
language to Turkish. That did not need much effort, incidentally, because in the eleventh
century all peoples from the azure waters of the Sea of Marmara and the forested slopes of
the Carpathians to the jungles of Bengal and the Great Wall of China spoke dialects of the
Turkish language. Such a broad distribution of Turkish-speaking made this language
convenient for trading operations, and the inhabitants of the oases of both halves of
Central Asia were identically fond of trading. Change of a native but little used language
for a generally accepted one therefore happened without difficulty, not only in the
north-east of the Tarim basin but also in the south-west, where the role of the Uighurs
had been taken on by the Turkish Yagma and Karluk tribes. But the difference between them
and the Uighurs was immense. The Uighurs did not affect the way of life, religion, or
culture of their subjects, but the Karluks, who had adopted Islam in A.D. 960, converted
the Yashgar, Yarkand, and Khotan oases into likenesses of Samarkand and Bukhara.</p>

<p>A geographically monolithic region thus proved to be divided into two ethno-cultural
provinces by no means friendly to one another. But the forces were balanced, and the
distances between the oases were vast and almost impassable. The position therefore became
stabilized for a long time.</p>

<p>This situation explains why the country remained without a single name. In antiquity
the Chinese called it Xiyu, i.e. the 'Western Territory', and considered its end to be the
'Bow Mountains', the Pamirs and Altai. The Hellenes called this land 'Serika' and the
precious commodity obtained from it <i>serikos </i>(silk). I shall not bother to explain
the etymology of this word.</p>

<p>In modern times conventional names have also been used Kashgaria, Eastern Turkestan, or
Sinkiang, i.e. literally the 'new frontier' established by the Manchurians in the
eighteenth century. None of these names are suitable for our times. What was the 'West'
for the ancient Chinese became the middle in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. To call
a country inhabited by Indo-Europeans who have learned to understand Turkish speech
'Turkestan' is stupid. Kashgar never became the capital, and the 'New Frontier' did not
seem to be even the horizon. Best of all we are left with the geographical conventional
name, the Tarim basin. The river is a reliable reference point, in any case neutral and
lasting. In addition the term 'Sinkiang' includes Jungaria (also a conventional and later
name), located north of the Tien Shan, which had a quite different historical fate.</p>

<p>The eastern boundary of Uighuria is difficult to define. Since the disappearance of the
river it has shifted significantly and many of the changes have not been dated. It can be
thought that the Hami oasis belonged to the Uighurs, and perhaps the cave town of
Tunhuang, a treasure-house of Buddhist art. But the more eastern lands, the oases of the
Nan Shan foothills, were taken from the Uighurs by the Tanguts. These were a people which,
like the Uighurs, do not now exist, although there are people who call themselves such.
But that, too, is a mirage. The people calling themselves Uighurs are Ferghana Turks who
settled in the east in the fifteenth to eighteenth centuries. And those who are taken for
Tanguts are nomadic Tibetans, a relict ethnos who were once the most savage enemies of the
Tanguts.</p>

<p>So, a historical critique shows that the meaning of name and the sound of it do not
always correspond in Asia. In order to avoid annoying and, alas, frequent mistakes, one
must develop a system of reckoning that would be real for Europe and Asia and America,
Oceania, Africa, and Australia. But in this system sense will be preferred to phonetics,
i.e. it will be based on history rather than on linguistics.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><i>'States' and 'processes'. </i></strong></font>The
aggregate of adduced facts indicates that the system of reference taking socioeconomic
formations as its basis does not apply in principle to ethnogenesis. This system fixes
'states' of society determined by the mode of production, which in turn depends on the
level of the productive forces, in other words on technosphere. This system of reference
is very convenient for studying the history of material culture, state institutions,
styles in art, philosophical schools, in short for everything created by people. It has
become so customary over the past century that it has been mechanically transferred to the
analysis of ethnogenesis.</p>

<p>The concept 'state' has its place in both nature and society. In nature there are four
states: solid, liquid, gaseous, and plasma. The transition of a molecule of inanimate
matter from one state to another occurs through a certain expenditure of energy (the
latent heat of melting or the generation of steam), i.e. a small jump; and the process is
reversible. In the live matter of the biosphere this transition is linked with death of
the organism, and is irreversible. That can mean that there are only two states, viz.,
life and death, for an organism, but since death is annihilation of the organism as an
entity, it is ridiculous to call this moment of transition a 'state'. As for an organism's
life, it too is not a 'state' but a process - from birth through an acme form in which
there is reproduction, to death. The analogy of the process of life in inanimate matter is
the crystallization of minerals and their subsequent metamorphosis into amorphous masses.</p>

<p>When studying 'states' and 'processes' we always employ different methods: for
'states', classification, by any conventionally accepted principle convenient for
surveying the phenomenon as whole; for 'processes', particularly linked with evolution or
the formation of species, systematics is needed, based on a hierarchical principle, i.e.
the correlation of similar although not identical groups of different rank. Such is
Linnaeus' systematics perfected by Darwin. The hierarchical character of the system of the
organic world is governed by the course and character of evolutionary processes
inseparable from life and obligatory for it. But as soon as life dies a state' arises,
more or less rapidly broken up by the action of the environment, although the latter is
constituted by other dead 'states' also subject to irreversible deformation. For an
organism, including the human organism, of course, there is only one mode of reaching a
'state', viz., to become a mummy, and for an ethnos to become an archaeological culture.</p>

<p>It is otherwise with the technosphere and the relations of production associated with
it. In it there are 'states'. It is easy to make scrap of a tractor, and a tractor from
scrap. Only expenditure of a certain (alas, not small) amount of energy is required. There
are also 'states' in social life. They used to be called estates (йtat). In a
metaphorical sense one can call class affiliation a 'state', but it must be remembered
that it is the product of relations of production and of the productive forces, i.e. also
of the technosphere. This state is extremely unstable. A warrior taken prisoner became a
slave, but having run away could become a feudal lord. There is no place or <i>need </i>for
the hierarchical principle in the fate of such a person. simple recording is sufficient.
Changes of social states are similar (though not identical), for instance, to changes of
natural states they are reversible and require, for passage from one state to another, an
investment of additional energy. But what is an ethnos? Can one, by making an effort,
change one's ethnic affiliation? Seemingly not! But that already indicates that an ethnos
is not a 'state' but a 'process'.</p>

<p>A second argument against the conception of 'state' is the erosion of boundaries
between ethnoi in zones of ethnic contacts. If the change of social state is, as a rule, a
once-and-for-all act, for example, the ennobling of the gentry, demotion to the ranks,
sale into slavery, emancipation from bondage, etc., the mixing of peoples in the valley of
the Huangho or in Constantinople, or in North America, is always a painful, long, and
extremely variable process, in the sense that the results of interbreeding often prove
unexpected and are always uncontrollable, which is due mainly to the absence of a
developed ethnological theory that would make it possible to act with due allowance for
the consequences of one's actions, and not blindly.</p>

Oirats were killed'. A tremendous event sank into red tape; and was it really the only
