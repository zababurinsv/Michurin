<h4 align="center">Ethnos and Ethnonym</h4>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Names deceive.</strong></font> </i>When one is
studying the general patterns of ethnology one must remember above all that a real ethnos
and an ethnonym, i.e. ethnic name, are not the same thing. We often encounter several
different ethnoi bearing one and the same name; conversely, one ethnos may be called
differently. The word 'Romans' <i>(romani), </i>for instance, originally meant a citizen
of the <i>polis </i>Rome, but not at all the Italics and not even the Latins who inhabited
other towns of Latium. In the epoch of the Roman Empire in the first and second centuries
A.D. the number of Romans increased through the inclusion among them of all
Italians-Etruscans, Samnites, Ligurians, Gauls, and many inhabitants of the provinces, by
no means of Latin origin. After the edict of Caracalla in A.D. 212 all free inhabitants of
municipalities on the territory of the Roman Empire were called 'Romans', i.e. Greeks,
Cappadocians, Jews, Berbers, Gauls, Illyrians, Germans, etc. The concept 'Roman' lost its
ethnic meaning, as it were, but that was not so; it simply changed it. The general element
became unity not even of culture, but of historical fate, instead of unity of origin and
language. The ethnos existed in that form for three centuries, a considerable period, and
did not break up. On the contrary, it was transformed in the fourth and fifth centuries
A.D., through the adoption of Christianity as the state religion, which began to be the
determinant principle after the fourth ecumenical council. Those who recognized these
councils sanctioned by the state authority were Romans, and those who did not became
enemies. A new ethnos was formed on that basis, that I conventionally call 'Byzantine',
but they themselves called themselves 'Romaic', i.e. 'Romans', though they spoke Greek. A
large number of Slavs, Armenians, and Syrians were gradually merged among the Romaic, but
they retained the name 'Romans' until 1453, until the fall of Constantinople. The Romaic
considered precisely themselves 'Romans', but not the population of Italy, where
Langobards had become feudal lords, Syrian Semites (who had settled in Italy, then
becoming deserted, in the first to third centuries A.D.) the townsmen, and the former
colons from prisoners of war of all peoples at any time conquered by the Romans of the
Empire became peasants. Florentines, Genoese, Venetians, and other inhabitants of Italy
considered themselves 'Romans', and not the Greeks, and on those grounds claimed the
priority of Rome where only ruins remained of the antique city.</p>

<p>A third branch of the ethnonym 'Romans' arose on the Danube, which had been a place of
exile after the Roman conquest of Dacia. There Phrygians, Cappadocians, Thracians,
Galatians, Syrians, Greeks, Illyrians, in short, all the eastern subjects of the Roman
Empire, served sentences for rebellion against Roman rule. To understand one another they
conversed in the generally known Latin tongue. When the Roman legions left Dacia, the
descendants of the exiled settlers remained and formed an ethnos that took the name
'Romanian', i.e. 'Roman', in the nineteenth century.</p>

<p>If one can treat the continuity between 'Romans' of the age of the Republic and the
'Roman citizens' of the late Empire, even as a gradual extension of the concept
functionally associated with the spread of culture, there is no such link even between the
Byzantines and the Romans, from which it follows that the word changed meaning and content
and cannot serve as an identifying attribute of the ethnos. It is obviously also necessary
to take into consideration the context in which the word and so the epoch has a semantic
content because the meaning of words changes in the course of time. That is even more
indicative when we analyze the ethnonyms 'Turk', 'Tatar', and 'Mongol', an example that
cannot be left aside.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Examples of camouflage.</strong></font> </i>In the
sixth century A.D. a small people living on the eastern slopes of the Altai and Khangai
mountains were called Turks. Through several successful wars they managed to subordinate
the whole steppe from Hingan to the Sea of Azov. The subjects of the Great
Kaghanate, who
preserved their own ethnonyms for internal use, also began to be called Turks, since they
were subject to the Turkish Khan. When the Arabs conquered Sogdiana and clashed with the
nomads, they began to call all of them Turks, including the Ugro-Magyars. In the
eighteenth century European scholars called all nomads 'les Tartars', and in the
nineteenth century, when linguistic classification became fashionable, the name 'Turk' was
arrogated to a definite group of languages. Many peoples thus fell into the category
'Turk' who had not formed part of it in antiquity, for example the Yakuts, Chuvash and the
hybrid people, the Ottoman Turks (about whose origin I have spoken above).</p>

<p>The modification of the ethnonym 'Tatar' is an example of direct camouflage. Up to the
twelfth century this was the ethnic name of a group of 30 big clans inhabiting the banks
of the Korulen. In the twelfth century this nationality increased in numbers, and Chinese
geographers began to call all the Central Asian nomads (Turkish. speaking,
Tungus-speaking, and Mongol-speaking), including the Mongols, Tatars. And even when, in
1206, Genghis-khan officially called all his subjects Mongols, neighbors continued for
some time from habit to call them Tatars. In this form the word 'Tatar' reached Eastern
Europe as a synonym of the word 'Mongol', and became acclimatized in the Volga Valley
where the local population began, as a mark of loyalty to the Khan of the Golden Horde to
call themselves Tatars. But the original bearers of this name (Kereites, Naimans, Oirats,
and Tatars) began to call themselves Mongols. <a name="ebe2text1"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note1">[+1]</a> The names thus
changed places. Since that time a scientific terminology arose in which the Tatar
anthropological type began to be called 'Mongoloid', and the language of the Volga
Kipchak-Turks Tatar. In other words we even employ an obviously camouflaged terminology in
science.</p>

<p>But then it is not simply a matter of confusion, but of an ethnonymic phantasmagoria.
Not all the nomad subjects of the Golden Horde were loyal to its government. The rebels
who lived in the steppes west of the Urals began to call themselves Nogai, and those who
lived on the eastern borders of the Jochi ulus, in Tarbagatai and on the banks of the
Irtysh, and who were practically independent, because of their remoteness from the
capital, became the ancestors of the Kazakhs. These ethnoi arose in the fourteenth and
fifteenth centuries as a consequence of rapid mixing of various ethnic components. The
ancestors of the Nogai were the Polovtsy, steppe Alans, Central Asian Turks, who survived
a defeat by Batu and were taken into the Mongol army, and inhabitants of the southern
frontier of Rus, who adopted Islam, which became a symbol at that time of ethnic
consolidation. The Tatars included Kama Bulgars, Khazars, and Burtasy, and also some of
the Polovtsy and Ugric Mishari. The population of the White Horde was the mixture; three
Kazakh <i>jus </i>were formed from it in the fifteenth century. But that is not yet all.</p>

<p>At the end of the fifteenth century Russian bands from the Upper Volga began to attack
the Middle Volga Tatar towns, forced some of the population to quit their homeland and go
off into Central Asia under the chieftainship of Sheibani-khan (1500-1510). There they
were met as fierce enemies because the local Turks who at that time bore the name of
'Chagatai' (after Genghis-khan's second son Chagatei, the chief of the Central Asian
ulus), where ruled by descendants of Timur, the enemy of the steppe and Volga Tatars, who
ravaged the Volga Valley in 1398-1399.</p>

<p>The members of the horde who quit their homeland took on a new name 'Uzbeks' to honor
the Khan Uzbeg (1312-1341), who had established Islam in the Golden Horde as the state
religion. In the sixteenth century the 'Uzbeks' defeated Babur, the last of the Timurides,
who led the remnants of his supporters into India and conquered a new kingdom for himself
there. So the Turks who remained in Samarkand and Ferghana bear the name of their
conquerors, the Uzbeks. The same Turks, who went to India, began to be called 'Moghuls' in
memory of their having been, three hundred years earlier, subject to the Mongol Empire.
But the genuine Mongols who settled in eastern Iran in the thirteenth century, and even
retained their language, are called Khazareitsy from the Persian word <i>khazar</i> -a
thousand (meaning a military unit, or division).</p>

<p>But where are the Mongols, by whose name the yoke that lay on Rus for 240 years is
known? They were not an ethnos, because by Genghis-khan's will Jochi, Batu, Orda, and
Sheibani each received 4 000 warriors, of whom only part came from the Far East. The
latter were called 'Kins' and not 'Tatars', from the Chinese name of the Jurchen. This
rare name occurred for the last time in the <i>Zadonshchina, </i>in which Mamai was called
Kinnish. Consequently, the yoke was not Mongol at all, but was enforced by the ancestors
of the nomad Uzbeks, who should not be confused with the settled Uzbeks, although they
merged in the nineteenth century, and now constitute a single ethnos, who equally revere
the Timurides and the Sheibanides, who were deadly enemies in the sixteenth century,
because that enmity had already lost sense and meaning in the seventeenth century.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The helplessness of philology and history.</strong></font>
</i>The examples cited are sufficient to establish that the ethnic name or even the own
name and the phenomenon of an ethnos as a stable collective of the species <i>Homo
sapiens, </i>by no means cover each other. Therefore the philological method, which
investigates words, is inapplicable in ethnology, and we have to turn to history, in order
to check how far this discipline can help with the posing of my problem. But here, too, we
come up against unexpected difficulties. The unit of investigation employed by historical
science is the social institution which may be a state, a tribal union, a religious sect,
a trading company, a political party, etc., in short, any institution in any age, and
among any peoples. The institution of the state and the ethnos sometimes coincide, and
then in some cases we observe nations of a modern type. But that is a case characteristic
of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries; in antiquity such coincidences were rare. It
happens that a religious sect unites like-minded persons who, like the Sikhs, for example,
in India, merge into an ethnos; then the origin of people incorporated by the community is
not taken into account. But such communities are often unstable and break up into ethnoi
as happened to the Muslim community founded by Muhammed in the seventh century A.D. While
a process of the merging of Arab tribes, Syrians, and in part Persians, into a single
ethnos took part under the first four Caliphs in the countries of Islam, that process had
already ceased under the Ommiades (A.D. 651-750), and under the Abbasides, the descendants
of the conquerors and the conquered merged into new ethnoi with a single interethnic
culture conventionally called 'Muhammedan', with Arabic, and awareness of its unity by
comparison with Christians and pagans, but with different historical fates and different
stereotypes of behavior, which were expressed in the creation of diverse sects and
ideological conceptions.</p>

<p>The emirates and sultanates that arose through the isolation of ethnoi would seem to
have corresponded to the ethnic boundaries, but that was not so. Successful commanders
subordinated territories to themselves for a short time with a population speaking
different languages, but these later became the victims of neighbors, i.e. the political
formations had a different fate than the ethnic entity. Community of historical fate of
course encouraged the formation and maintenance of an ethnos, but historical fate <a name="ebe2text2"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note2">[+2]</a> can also be the same for two or three nationalities and
different for two parts of a single one. The Anglo-Saxons and Celtic Welsh, for example,
have been united state-wise since the thirteenth century, but they have not merged into
one ethnos, which incidentally does not prevent them from living in peace; the eastern
Armenians, already subject to Iran in the third century A.D., and the western, connected
from that time with Byzantium; had different fates, but their ethnic unity was not
disrupted. In the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries the French Huguenots and Catholics
were very different in their historical fates, and even in the character of their culture,
both before the Edict of Nantes, and after its repeal. But the ethnic integrity of France
remained unaltered in spite of bloody wars and dragonnades. The forming of an ethnos, i.e.
ethnogenesis, consequently lies deeper than the apparent historical processes recorded by
the sources. History can help ethnology but not replace it.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p align="center"><b>Mosaic Structure as a Property of an Ethnos</b></p>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>It is possible to manage without a gentile system.</strong></font>
</i>Many ethnoi are divided into tribes and clans. Can this division be considered an
obligatory, essential quality of an ethnos? Or even the first stage in its formation? Or
finally the form of a collective preceding the development of the ethnos itself? The
reliable material at our disposal makes it possible to answer 'No!'.</p>

<p>First of all, far from all contemporary peoples have or had any kind of gentile or
tribal division. There were not and are not such among the Spaniards, French, Italians,
Romanians, English, Ottoman Turks, Great Russians, Ukrainians, Sikhs, Greeks (not
Hellenes), and many other nations. But a clan or gentile system exists among Celts,
Kazakhs, Mongols, Tungus, Arabs, Kurds, and a number of other peoples.</p>

<p>It is difficult to consider a gentile system an earlier stage, because the Byzantines
or the Sassanid Persians were people formed a thousand years earlier than the Mongols and
1 200 years earlier than the Kazakhs, and they got along magnificently without clans and
phratries. One can, of course, suppose that a system of clans was general in antiquity,
but if so, such an assumption has no relation to the historical period when peoples
(ethnoi) arose before the historian's eyes. It is more correct to recognize that the
schema √ clan, tribe, people, nation √ applies to social development, i.e. lies
on a different plane.</p>

<p>That the predominant forms of community life were different forms of family over the
time of the existence of Homo sapiens, viz., group marriage, the punaluan family, pairing
marriage, the monogamous family, <a name="ebe2text3"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note3">[+3]</a> is quite well substantiated
and demonstrated, but it has no direct relation to my problem, since an ethnic entity does
not coincide either with the family cell or with the level of production and culture. I
must therefore look for other criteria and other identification signs in my study.</p>

<p>At the same time one must note that among peoples with a gentile-tribal system, the
division into clans (among Celts), phratries <i>(seok </i>among Altaitsy), and tribal
associations (<i>jus</i> among Kazakhs), etc., is constructive. These intraethnic units
are needed in order to maintain the ethnic entity itself. The relations both of the
separate individuals to the ethnos as a whole, and of gentile or family collectives among
themselves are regulated through the division into groups. Exogamy preventing
blood-related marriages is only maintained by this means. The members of a clan or family
express the will of their fellow-tribesmen at folk gatherings and create stable alliances
so as to wage external wars, both defensive and offensive. In Scotland, for example, the
clan system withstood the raids of Vikings in the tenth century, the attacks of feudal
lords in the twelfth to fifteenth centuries, and war with the English bourgeoisie in the
seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and only capitalist relations were able to disrupt
it. Where the clan system was less expressed, among the Elbe Slavs, for example, German
and Danish knights made short work of it in two centuries (eleventh and twelfth), in spite
of the undisputed bellicosity and enviable courage of the Bodrichi, Lutichi (Veleti), and
the inhabitants of the island of Rьgen. The division of an ethnos into tribes had the
function of a skeleton on which muscles could grow, and so gather strength for struggle,
against the environment.</p>

<p>Let me try to propose another system of reference suitable not for some but for the
whole aggregate of observed collisions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>What the gentile system was replaced by.</strong></font>
</i>How was the absence of gentile-tribal groups made good among quite developed peoples
who were at the stage of class society? The class stricture and class struggle in
slaveowning, feudal, and capitalist formations are an established fact and do not need
examinations. The division into classes cannot, consequently, be functionally analogous to
division into tribes. And in fact we observe, parallel to the division of society into
classes, a division of ethnoi into groups that by no means coincide with classes. They can
be conventionally called 'corporations', but that word corresponds to the concept only as
a first approximation, and will subsequently be replaced.</p>

<p>In feudal Europe, for example, the dominant class within an ethnos (the French, say)
consisted of various corporations: (1) the barons or feudal lords in the direct sense,
i.e. the holders of fiefs linked with crown by a vassal oath; (2) knights, united in
orders; (3) <i>notables, </i>who constitutes the apparatus of royal power <i>(noblesse des
robes); </i>(4) the higher clergy; (5) scholars (for example, the professors of the
Sorbonne); (6) the urban patriciate, which was itself divided territorially, and so on.
According to the accepted degree of approximation one can distinguish a greater or less
number of groups, but one must necessarily, in that connection, still allow for membership
of parties, for example, the Armagnac and Burgundian at the beginning of the fifteenth
century. As for the popular masses, such a division is applicable to an even greater
degree, since each feudal province then had a clearly expressed individual character. In
the twelfth century, for example, people of Rouen displayed hostility to Philippe II
Auguste, who had liberated them from the English, and the Provencals, learning of Louis
IX's plan in Egypt, sang a <i>Te Deum, </i>hoping to be delivered from the <i>Sires</i>. <a name="ebe2text4"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note4">[+4]</a> 
We no longer see such corporations in bourgeois society,
but the principle remains unchanged. For each individual within ethnoi there are, besides
classes, people of 'his' circle and 'others'. But, as regards foreign expansion, all these
groups acted as a single whole, as Frenchmen.</p>

<p>It is indisputable that 'corporations', as I have conditionally called them, are much
less stable and viable than gentile-tribal groupings, but the latter, too, are not
eternal. The difference between them and other groups is not, of course, one of principle.
The similarity is that they have an identical functional purpose, maintaining unity of the
ethnos through internal division.</p>

<p>The most important, and curious point is that 'corporations' differ from one another in
their origin only by nuances of psychology, but the differences deepen and crystallize
with time, passing into customs and rituals, i.e. into phenomena studied by ethnographers.
The Old Slavonic kissing custom, for example, was transformed in Russia and Poland into
kissing of the hands of married ladies and was retained among the landed nobility, but
disappeared from the life of other strata of the population.</p>

<p>Maxim Gorky, who observed the life of the lower middle class and middle class
intellectuals in the Volga towns, noted such deep differences that he suggested treating
these recently formed groups of the population as 'different tribes'. To some extent that
was true, and Gorky was right in recording the differences in everyday fife, morals, and
notions, and his observances were fruitful. In our day these differences have been nearly
wiped out. They were characteristic of a short period - around 80 years - but I have
already said that the duration of a phenomenon does not affect the fundamental aspect of
the matter.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The formation of ethnic subgroups.</strong></font> </i>The
concept of 'corporation' in the sense proposed is clear, but it is not sufficient for my
analysis since it suggests that a given unit is not only formed from ethnographic features
but is also demarcated from other 'corporations' by social barriers. Subethnic
subdivisions often do not coincide with social ones, which indicates that the example
adduced is a partial case of the general rule I am seeking.</p>

<p>Let us turn to the ethnogenesis of the French. In the sixteenth century the Reformation
affected this people, and reshuffled all the former 'corporations' among them till they
were unrecognizable. The feudal aristocracy, the petty nobility, the bourgeoisie, and the
peasantry proved to be split into 'Papists' and 'Huguenots'. The social bases of both
groups did not differ, but ethno-territorial subdivisions were distinctly visible.
Calvinism was successful among the Celts of the lower Loire, where merchant La Rochelle
became a stronghold of the reformers. The Gascon seigneurs and Kings of Navarre adopted
Calvinism. The descendants of the Burgundians, the peasants of the Cevennes, and the heirs
of the Albigenses, the bourgeois of Languedoc, joined the movement. But Paris, Lorraine,
and Central France remained faithful to the Roman Church. All the former 'corporations'
disappeared, since belonging to a 'community' or 'church' became an indicator, for two
centuries, of membership of one ethnic sub-unit or another.</p>

<p>One cannot say that theology played a decisive role. Most Frenchmen were 'politicians',
i.e. refused to be interested in the disputes of the Sorbonne and Geneva. The illiterate
Gascon barons, the semi-savage Cevennes highlanders, the bold corsairs of La Rochelle, or
the artisans of the suburbs of Paris and Angers by no means understood the fine points of
the interpretation of Predestination or Pre-existence. If some gave their lives for the
Mass or for the Bible, that meant that the one or the other was a symbol of their
self-assertion and opposition to one another, and so an indicator of deep contradictions.
These were not class contradictions, since nobles, peasants, and bourgeois fought on both
sides. But Catholics and Huguenots really were divided by stereotypes of behavior, and
that, as we agreed at the beginning, is the main principle of ethnic peculiarity, for
which there are adequate grounds.</p>

<p>But what if the Huguenots had kept a patch of land for themselves and created an
independent state like, say, the Swiss or the North Americans? They would probably have
been regarded as a special ethnos arising through the zigzags of historical fate, because
they would have had a special way of life, culture, mentality, and perhaps language, since
they would hardly have conversed in Parisian, but would rather have chosen one of their
local dialects. It would have been a process similar, to the separation of the Americans
from the English.</p>

<p>The Scots are undoubtedly an ethnos, but they are composed of Highlanders (Celts) and
Lowlanders (inhabitants of the valley of the Tweed). Their origin is different. The old
population, the Caledonians (Picts) who painted themselves repulsed the onslaught of the
Romans in the first and second centuries A.D. In the third century Scots migrating from
Ireland were added to them. Both tribes made destructive raids on Romanized Britannia, and
then on the northern fringes of England, and fought against the Norwegian Vikings who had
established themselves in the east of the island. In A.D. 954 the Scots were fortunate:
they conquered Lothian, the plain on the banks of the Tweed settled by descendants of
Saxons and Norse Vikings. The Scottish kings acquired many rich subjects and, enjoying
their aid and support, limited the independence of the chiefs of the Celtic clans. But
they had to adopt many of the customs of their subjects, in particular feudal institutions
and manners and customs. The rich, energetic inhabitants of Lothian compelled their Celtic
sovereigns to turn Scotland into a small kingdom, because they had taken on defense of the
borders with England. In the fourteenth century French adventurers, comrades-in-arms of
John Baliol and Robert Bruce, poured into Scotland for the war with England. The French
increased the number of border barons. The Reformation mainly embraced the Celts, but in
the valleys Catholics held their ground with the Calvinists. In short, races and cultures,
a clan system and feudalism were merged during the genesis of this people, but the
complexity of its composition did not disrupt its monolithic ethnic character, which was
manifested in clashes with the English, and later with Irish.</p>

<p>Russian Old Believers are another characteristic example of a different order. They
were a small section of the Great Russians who did not adopt certain reforms of Church
ritual proclaimed by the Patriarch Nikon in the seventeenth century. At that time the
church service had the function not only of religion, but also of a synthetic art, i.e.
filled an aesthetic vacuum. Therefore the requirements in performance of the rites and
rituals were very high. But, as in our day, far from all immediately recognized and
adopted the new style and trend in music or, for example, in painting, so the replacement
of dark images in the seventeenth century by new rose and blue icons shocked a certain
part of the worshippers. They simply could not concentrate in a situation that irritated
them.</p>

<p>In reality, there was almost the same split of the ethnos as happened in Western Europe
during the Reformation. Not all the Orthodox Christians plumped for the old ritual, but
those who did clung firmly to it, fearing neither execution nor torture. When there was a
chance they passed to the counter-attack, and dealt with the iconolaters as sharply as
they with them. That happened during the Strelets uprising at the time of the regency of
Czarevna Sophia. The heat of passions was identical on both sides. In the seventeenth
century the dispute was only about Church ritual, but in other respects (in everyday life,
the system of education, habits and customs) the Old Believers were indistinguishable from
the general mass of Russians. In the second generation, under Peter the Great, they
constituted a definite, isolated group of the population. At the end of the eighteenth
century customs, rituals, and dress developed, and partly were retained, among them, that
differed markedly from those generally accepted. Catherine II banned persecution of Old
Believers, but that did not lead to their merging back into the main mass of the ethnos.
Millionaire merchants, Cossacks, and the semi-destitute Transvolgan peasants formed part
of the newly formed intraethnic entity. This entity, initially united by a community of
fate, i.e. by attachment to principles so dear that they went to their death for them,
became a group united by a community of way of life, headed by spiritual leaders
(teachers) of various branches and trends. In the twentieth century it gradually began to
break up, since the reason for its origin had long ceased to exist, and it only remained
through inertia.</p>

<p>The examples I have cited are clear, but rare. The functions of intraethnic groups were
more often assumed by naturally formed territorial associations of fellow-countrymen. The
existence of such divisions, like the existence of phratries in the gentile system, does
not undermine ethnic unity.</p>

<p>We can now draw conclusions. The social forms in which intraethnic entities are
embodied are vague and do not always coincide with the subdivisions of an ethnos.
Intraethnic splintering is a condition that maintains the unity of the ethnos and gives it
stability. It is characteristic of any time and stage of development.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Variation of ethic contacts.</strong></font> </i>So
far I have examined separate groups within big ethnoi but the problem is by no means
exhausted by that. Pure forms of ethnoi are not observed in the real historical process,
but rather various variants of ethnic contacts arising in territories inhabited by
different ethnoi, united politically in a polyethnic state. Four variants can be when we
study their relations: (a) coexistence, in which the ethnoi do not merge and do not
imitate each other, borrowing only technical innovations; (b) assimilation, i.e. the
swallowing-up of one ethnos by another with complete forgetting of origin and old
traditions; (c) cross-breeding, in which traditions of the preceding ethnoi and a memory
of the ancestors are retained and combined (these variants are usually unstable, and exist
through replenishment by new metises); (d) merging, in which the traditions of the
original components are forgotten and a third, new ethnos arises alongside the two
precursors, or in place of them. That is essentially the main variant of
ethnogenesis. For
some reason it is observed less frequently than all the others.</p>

<p>Let me illustrate this four-part schema by clear examples. Variant <i>a </i>is the most
common.</p>

<p>All things and phenomena are recognized by their interactions. Soda and citric acid
poured together give a reaction of neutralization with a vigorous fizzing only when water
is poured on them. In history reactions go on all the time, as in an aqueous solution, and
there is no hope of that being finished.</p>

<p>Even the simple coexistence of different ethnoi with rapprochement and growing intimacy
is not neutral. Sometimes it is simply necessary. In the upper reaches of the Congo, for
instance, Bantu and pygmies live in a symbiosis. The Negroes cannot move in the forest,
except by paths, without the help of the pygmies, while the paths are rapidly overgrown
unless cleared. The Bantu can get lost in the forest, like a European, and die within
twenty meters of his own home. But the pygmies need knives, vessels, and other articles of
daily use. For these two ethnoi dissimilarity is the guarantee of well-being, and their
friendship is founded on that.</p>

<p>A variant of lengthy coexistence with constant enmity was wen described by Leo Tolstoy,
who observed the skirmishes of Greben Cossacks and Chechens. But he faithfully noted the
mutual respect of the two neighboring ethnoi and the wariness of the Cossacks toward the
soldiers who were the pioneers on the Terek of assimilation of the Cossacks by the Great
Russians, which was completed by the beginning of the twentieth century.</p>

<p>Variant <i>b</i>, assimilation, usually occurs through methods not so much bloody as
shameful. The object of assimilation is presented with an alternative: abandon either
conscience or life. It can avoid death by repudiating everything dear and accustomed for
the sake of being converted into a second-class person among the victors. The latter also
gain little since they acquire hypocritical and, as a rule, inferior fellow-countrymen,
because only the outward manifestation of the behavior of the conquered ethnos can be
controlled, and not its mood. The Irish persuaded the English of that in the nineteenth
century, Simon Bolivar's partisans the Spaniards, and the Dungans the Chinese. There are
too many examples but the matter is clear.</p>

<p>Variant <i>c </i>√ cross-breeding √ is observed very often, but the progeny
of exogamous marriages either die out in the third or fourth generation, or break up into
paternal and maternal lines. For example, in the sixteenth century the Turks considered it
sufficient to pronounce the formula of professing Islam and submitting to the Sultan to
become a true Turk. In other words they regarded ethnic affiliation a 'state' that could
be changed at will. Turks therefore willingly took any adventurers into service if they
were specialists in some craft or in the art of war. The consequences of that made
themselves felt within a hundred years.</p>

<p>The decline of the Sublime Porte in the seventeenth century attracted the attention in
its time of contemporaneous Turkish writers. In their view <i>ajen-oglani, </i>i.e. the
children of renegades, were the reason for the decline. The influx of the foreign-born
spoiled the stereotype of behavior, which told in the venality of viziers, the
purchasability of judges, the fall in the fighting capacity of troops, and the collapse of
the economy. By the beginning of the nineteenth century Turkey had become the 'sick man'.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The role of exogamy.</strong></font> </i>The
introduction of foreigners into Turkey sharpened the crisis of class contradictions
already growing without that, for which the conversion of ethnic unity into a chimera
played the role of catalyst, because everyone understood that sincere, loyal officials
were more valuable than hypocritical, unprincipled ones. Conversely, the development of
class contradictions played the role of a vector for the ethnogenesis of the Ottoman
ethnos. The combination of ethnic and social processes in one region was a factor of the
anthropogenic destruction of the terrain of what had once been the richest countries in
the world, called in antiquity the 'Fertile Crescent'. Selim I's conquest in the sixteenth
century put Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and Mesopotamia, where intensive agriculture had
already transformed the original landscape in the third millennium B.C., into the hands of
the Ottoman sultans.</p>

<p>The Sumerians had 'divided the water from the land' in the lower reaches of the Tigris
and Euphrates, and contemporaries called the land they created 'Eden'. The Akkadians built
Babylon, the 'Gate of God', the first city in the world with a million inhabitants, for
which there was enough food without imports from far countries. Antioch, and later
Damascus, were large, gay, cultured cities flourishing at the expense of local resources.
Asia Minor fed huge Constantinople.</p>

<p>But the cultivated landscape had to be constantly maintained. The Arab Caliphs had
understood that, buying slaves in Zanzibar to keep up irrigation in Mesopotamia, and also
the Byzantine autocrats who had reinforced the small peasant farms by special edicts, as
the most intensive in those natural conditions, and even the Mongol Ilkhan Ghasan, who
organized the building of a canal in the waterless part of northern Mesopotamia. The
disintegration of the cultivated terrain of Western Asia set in later, in the seventeenth
to nineteenth centuries, during the profound peace and decline of the Ottoman Empire,
because the Syrian, Iranian, and Cilician peasants, worn out by exactions, abandoned their
plots and sought a better lot in the pirate coastal cities, where one could either get
rich easily or lay down one's life. And those who stayed at home through laziness or
cowardice, neglected the irrigation and turned the country, once rich and abundant, into a
wasteland.</p>

<p>The beginning of that terrible, disastrous process was already visible to
contemporaries. The French adventurer and doctor in Aureng-Zebe's guard, Francois Bernier,
who had observed similar things in India under the rule of the 'Great Moghul', predicted,
in a letter to Colbert, the inevitable weakening of the three great Muslim empires -
India, Turkey, and Persia - considering, as regards the last-named, that the decline would
be slow since the Persian aristocracy was of local origin. <a name="ebe2text5"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note5">[+5]</a>
And I must agree with him that, with a stable social system, and one and the same
formation, but with a changing ratio of the ethnic components in the political system
(state), the state of the countryside like a sensitive barometer, indicates the beginning
or the existence of rises and falls, and of periods of stabilization.</p>

<p>That being so, we have no grounds for denying the cause of the decline mentioned above,
namely the appearance in the system of new ethnic groups not linked with the terrain of
the region, and limitations on exogamous marriages, because these bans, by maintaining the
mixed ethnic nature of the region, lead to the preservation of terrains containing small
ethnic groups. But since that is so, then free intercourse and free love ruin nature and
culture!</p>

<p>That is an unexpected and alarming conclusion √ but it is a paraphrase of Newton's
second law, viz., that what is gained in social freedom is lost through contact with
nature, or rather with the geographical environment and one's own physiology, because
nature lies also within our bodies.</p>

<p>Since similar phenomena occurred in both Rome and ancient Iran, and in many other
countries, one can easily note a general pattern. When there is endogamy as an ethnic
barrier, things proceed more slowly and less painfully; but it is not all the same for an
ethnos whether it takes 300 or 1 000 years. Bromley's observation about the stabilizing
role of endogamy as a barrier against incorporation is therefore indisputable. <a name="ebe2text6"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note6">[+6]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>An experiment in interpretation.</strong></font> </i>Let
us try to interpret the phenomenon described. If ethnoi are processes, then, when two
dissimilar processes clash, interference will arise disturbing the rhythm of both
components. The resulting association will be chimeric, which means unstable to outside
effects and short-lived. Death of the chimeric system will entail annihilation of its
components and extinction of the people involved in the system. Such is the general
mechanism of the disruption of the pattern, but it has its exceptions, namely that with
slackening of the original rhythms a new one sometimes arises, i.e. a new ethnogenctic
inertial process. I shall not say yet what this is associated with, because this is too
serious a matter to resolve as a side-issue. But endogamy is clearly necessary in order to
maintain ethnic traditions, because the endogamous family passes on a developed stereotype
of behavior to a child, while an exogamous one passes on two stereotypes that mutually
cancel each other out. Exogamy, which is not related at all to 'social states' and lies on
a different plane, thus proves to be a factor of ethnogenesis, i.e. a real, destructive
factor during contact on a superethnic level. And even in rare cases when a new ethnos
develops in a zone of contact, it absorbs, i.e. annihilates, both of the former ones. In
conclusion, let me point out that in the example cited, and also in the overwhelming
majority of cases, the racial principle plays no role. It is not a matter of somatic
differences, but rather of behavioral ones, because the steppe dwellers, Tibetan
hillmen,
and Chinese belonged to a single, first-order Mongoloid race, and it is obvious that, with
closer approximation to second-order race, North Chinese are racially closer to
Xiang-bi
and Tibetans than to Southern Chinese. But the outward similarity of cranial indices, eye
color, hair color, epicanthus, etc., has no significance for ethnogenetic processes.</p>

<p>It is also obvious from the example adduced that the link between ethnos and
topography, sometimes doubted, really exists. The Hunni, having seized the valley of the
Huangho, pastured their cattle there; the Chinese acquired the arable, and built canals;
but their hybrids, not having the skills of either cattle-herding or cultivation,
predatorily fleeced neighbors and subjects, which led to the formation of long-fallow
lands and restoration of the natural biocoenosis, although impoverished by the cutting
down of forests and the killing of ungulates during the emperors hunts. Everything
tallies.</p>

<p>So, not only do theoretical considerations but also the necessity of interpreting the
factual data force us to reject the conception of an ethnos as a state. But if an ethnos
is the result of a long-lasting process of ethnogenesis, it is part of the biosphere of
Earth, and since changes of terrain through the use of technique are linked with an
ethnos, ethnology should be ranked among the geographical sciences although it draws its
initial material from history in the narrow sense of the term, i.e. study of events in
their connection and sequence.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="center">The Ethnic Stereotype of Behavior</h4>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Dissimilarity as a principle.</strong></font> </i>Every
ethnos has its own inner structure and its unique stereotype of behavior. Sometimes the
structure and stereotype change from generation to generation. That indicates that the
ethnos is developing, and that ethnogenesis is not, as a rule, dying away. The structure
is sometimes stable, because each new generation reproduces the life cycle of the
preceding one. Such ethnoi can be called persistent, i.e. enduring, but I shall be going
into that aspect of the matter below, and for the present will make the concept
'structure' more precise irrespective of its degree of stability and the character of its
variability.</p>

<p>The structure of an ethnos is a strictly defined standard of relations: (a) between the
collective and individual; (b) between individuals; (c) between intraethnic groups; (d)
and between the ethnos and its intraethnic groups. These norms are unique in each case, do
not exist visibly, change now rapidly and now slowly in all fields of living and everyday
life, being perceived in a given ethnos, and in each separate epoch, as the sole possible
mode of society and community life, and therefore by no means arduous for its members. On
the contrary, each member of one ethnos, on coming into contact with another, is surprised
and bewildered, and tries to tell his fellow-tribesmen about the funny ways of the other
people. Properly speaking, such stories constitute the science of ethnography, as ancient
as interethnic connections themselves.</p>

<p>Let me cite some examples. The Athenian, who had been to Olvia, related with
indignation that the Scythians had no houses, and got dead drunk during their festivals.
The Scythians, observing the bacchanalias of the Greeks, felt such loathing that once,
having seen their own king, who was staying in Olvia, in a wreath and with a thyrsus in
his hands, in a procession of jubilant Hellenes killed him. The Jews hated the Romans
because they ate pork, while the Romans considered the custom of circumcision unnatural.
The knights who conquered Palestine, were outraged by the Arab custom of polygamy, while
the Arabs considered the uncovered faces of French ladies shameless, and so on. There is a
great number of examples.</p>

<p>Ethnographic science has overcome such ingenuousness, and taken into observation
systems principles as the operative standards of the relations of individuals of these
different categories to the collective as a whole and to each other. Let me take as an
example the simple case of marital-sexual relations. Roughly speaking, we know monogamous,
polygamous, and polyandrous families, group marriages, unstable pairing marriages,
compulsory inheritance of wives (levirate), and even sometimes full freedom of sexual
relations. Among some peoples, we know, artlessness is compulsory in marriage for girls,
and among others preliminary training in love techniques. Divorce is sometimes easy
sometimes difficult, sometimes impossible at all. Among some peoples the cohabitation of
wives with other men is punished as marital infidelity, among others it is encouraged.</p>

<p>We can analyze variations of the perception of sense of duty in just the same way. In
feudal England or France, a vassal was obliged to serve only if he received a benefice
('salary'). Lacking such he had the right to transfer to another suzerain (for example, to
the Spanish king). Only transfer to an infidel, for example to Muslims, was considered
treason, but that happened so often that a special term 'renegade' arose (without a
pejorative nuance). In Rome or Greece, on the contrary, the performance of social
obligations was not accompanied with payment but was the duty of a citizen of the <i>polis.
</i>These citizens, incidentally, frequently got so much profit from public work that they
rewarded themselves beyond measure.</p>

<p>The strength of the ethnic stereotype of behavior is immense because the members of an
ethnos perceive their own stereotype as the only one worthy of a man who has the right to
respect, while all others are 'barbaric' or 'savage'. That is why European colonizers
called Indians, Africans, Mongols, and even Russians savages, although the same could as
rightly be said of the English. But Chinese haughtiness was even more categorical. Here,
for example, is what a geographical handbook of the Ch'in epoch said about France: 'It
lies in the, south-western sea... In 1518 the king sent an envoy with credentials and
requested that he be recognized as king.' <a name="ebe2text7"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note7">[+7]</a></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The variability of behavior stereotypes.</strong></font>
</i>An ethnos's stereotype of behavior is as dynamic as the ethnos itself. Rituals,
customs, and standards of relationship sometimes change slowly and gradually, and
sometimes very quickly. Take England, for example. Can one really recognize the
descendants of the berserker Saxon who murdered Celtic babies in the gay outlaw Robin Hood
or the archer of the 'White Bands', and his heir in the pirate-sailor of Sir Francis
Drake, or in Cromwell's Ironsides? And their heir, the City clerk in London? But England
had always been a country with stable traditions! What should be said about other
ethnoi,
whose image has not only been influenced by internal development but also by incidental
external effects (cultural borrowings, conquests involving forced changes of customs) and,
finally, by economic pressures changing the ethnos's kind of occupations and violently
regulating its needs. <a name="ebe2text8"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note8">[+8]</a> </p>

<p>When speaking of an ethnos's stereotype of behavior, we always have to indicate the
epoch we are concerned with. And it should not be thought that so-called 'savage' or
'primitive' tribes are more conservative than 'civilized' nations. That idea arose
exclusively as a consequence of lack of study of Indians, Africans, and Siberian peoples.
It was sufficient to organize the sale of whisky in Canada, or to import tinned goods into
Tahiti in exchange for copra, immediately to alter the behavior pattern of the Dakotas and
Polynesians, seldom for the better. But, in all cases, the changes took their own path on
the basis of already established habits and notions. That is the uniqueness of any
ethnogenetic process, and the reason why these processes never copy one another. But there
is also a pattern to it if one only knows how to find it.</p>

<p>Any number of examples could be proposed, including ones about complex standards of
behavior affecting legal, economic, social everyday, religious, and other relations,
however complex. In the jargon of the humanitarian sciences the phenomenon described is
known as a tradition or modification of social relations, but on the plane of the natural
sciences it is as legitimately treated as a stereotype of behavior that varies in local
zones and intraspecific populations. The second aspect, though unaccustomed, is, as we
shall see below, fruitful.</p>

<p>So, an ethnos is a collective of individuals that distinguishes itself from all other
collectives. It is more or less stable, although it arises and disappears in historical
time. There is no one real attribute for defining an ethnos applicable to all the cases
known to us. Language, origin, customs, material culture, and ideology are sometimes
determinant elements, but sometimes not. Let us take just one, viz., each individual's
recognition that 'we are such-and-such, and all others are different'. Since this
phenomenon is general, it consequently reflects some physical or biological reality that
is also my sought-for quantity. This 'quantity' can only be interpreted by analyzing the
origin and disappearance of ethnoi, and establishing the fundamental differences of ethnoi
from each other, and subsequently describing the behavior pattern of either of them so as
to distinguish their differences by means of comparison. But one must remember that an
ethnos's behavior changes with age, i.e. from the time of its entry onto the historical
arena. It is therefore necessary to introduce into the analysis a means of recording the
ethnodynamics so as to get a second approximation of the concept 'ethnos'. Such will be
the psychological element, on the one hand inherent in all people without exception, and
on the other hand quite variable, so as to serve as an indicator of the ethnic dynamics.
It is the relation of an ethnos as an entity to the category of time.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Ethnos and the four sensations of time.</strong></font>
</i>What is 'time'? No one knows. But people have learned to measure it. Even the most
primitive peoples, who have no need of a linear reckoning of time from some arbitrary date
√ 'the foundation of Rome', 'The Creation', the 'Birth of Christ', the 'Hegira'
(Muhammed's flight from Mecca to Medina), etc. - distinguish day and night, the seasons, a
'living chronology' according to the dates of their own life, and finally
cyclicity, i.e.
the week, month, twelve years, each of which bears the name of an animal (the
Turko-Mongolian calendar). The linear reckoning of time, as comparative ethnography has
shown, develops when an ethnos begins to feel its history not as something exclusive, but
in connection with the history of neighboring countries. And as knowledge accumulates a
quantification of time arises in people's consciousness, i.e. its division into epochs or
ages, very unequal in length but equivalent as regards content of events. The category of
'time' clashes here with the category of 'force', i.e. the cause stimulating acceleration,
in the special case, of the historical process.</p>

<p>Such a diversity of systems indicates that it responds to serious changes in the
consciousness of an ethnos itself, which indicates in turn a change of its ages. For my
purpose the system of reckoning is not important, but rather the difference in concepts of
past, present, and future.</p>

<p>When an ethnic community enters on the first creative period of its becoming, the
leading part of its population pushing the whole system along the path of ethnic
development, amasses material and ideological values. This accumulation becomes an
'imperative' in the field of ethics and is transformed as regards time into a feeling the
sense of which is that each active builder of the ethnic entity feels himself a continuer
of the ancestral line, to which he adds something (another victory, another building,
another copied manuscript, another forged sword). This 'other' suggests that the past has
not gone, but is in him, in the person, and it therefore behooves him to add whatever is
new, because the past is thus accumulated and advanced. Each minute lived is perceived as
addition to the existing past <i>(Passй existente).</i></p>

<p>A result of this perception of time is the feats of heroes, who have voluntarily laid
down their lives for the fatherland √ the Spartan basileus Leonidas at Thermopile,
the consul Marcus Attilius Regulus in Carthage, Roland at the pass of Roncevalles - this
being equally applicable to the historical Count of the Breton Marches and the literary
hero of the <i>Song of Roland. </i>Such, too, were the warrior monks Peresvet and
Oslvabva, who served with St. Sergius of Radonezh and died in the battle of Kulikovo, and
the Kerait warrior Khadakh-Baatur, who diverted Genghis-khan's troops onto himself so as
to let 'his natural khan' escape. In Europe people of that type built the Gothic
cathedrals, without perpetuating their names, in India carved the marvelous statues in the
cave temples, in Egypt built the pyramids, in Polynesia discovered America and brought
back to their fellow-countrymen the <i>kumara </i>(batata or sweet potato). An absence of
personal self-interest is characteristic of them. They seem to have loved their cause or
work more than themselves. But it was not altruism. The object of their love was in
themselves, but not just in themselves. They felt themselves not simply the heirs of great
traditions but also participants in them and gave their dear lives for them in an hour (as
in war) or in everyday work (as builder-architects). They acted in accordance with their
neuro-psycho-physical stamp, and the determinant vector and character of their activity.
People of that stamp are encountered in all epochs, but there are rather more of them in
the initial stages of ethnogenesis than in other ages. As soon as the proportion of them
diminishes a time sets in that we are accustomed to call 'flourishing', which should more
correctly be called 'squandering'.</p>

<p>Thought of the past is replaced by actualism. People of that stamp forget the past and
do not want to know the future. They want to live now and for themselves. They are
courageous, energetic, talented, but what they do they do for their own sake. They, too,
perform feats but for the sake of their own greed; they strive for the highest positions
in order to enjoy their power, because only the present is real for them, which they
inevitably understand as their personal present. Such were Gaius Marius and Lucius
Corne.
Bus Sulla in Rome, Alcibiades in Athens, the Prince of Condй, Louis XIV, and Napoleon in
France, Ivan the Terrible in Russia, the Sui emperor Yang-di in China (A.D. 605-618). But
it is impossible even to list the writers, artists, professors, etc., who sometimes
performed grandiose feats only in order to glorify their names! But such, too, are the gay
rakes, bon vivants, and wastrels. They also live for today and for themselves. When the
percentage of people of this stamp in an ethnos increases, the heritage accumulated by
their sacrificing ancestors is rapidly squandered, which creates a false impression of
abundance, and which is why it is considered 'flourishing'.</p>

<p>The reader may get an opinion that I condemn people of that mould. No! Their perception
of time is as legitimate a phenomenon as that described above, and does not depend on
their wishes but on the peculiarities of higher nervous activity. They could not be
otherwise, even if they wanted to. The famous maxims 'Every dog has his day' and 'After me
the deluge' were not cynicism but sincerity, and the presence of people of this stamp in
an ethnos leads not to its disappearance but only to a cessation of growth, which is
sometimes even expedient because these people, while doing no harm to themselves, do not
make it their aim to inflict sacrifices on their neighbors, and the striving for an
unlimited expansion of the ethnic territory is replaced by fixing natural frontiers.</p>

<p>A third possible and really existing variant of the attitude to time and the world is
an ignoring not only of the past but also of the present, for the sake of the future. The
past is rejected as disappeared, the present as unacceptable, and only the dream is
recognized as real. The clearest examples of this perception of the world are the idealism
of Plato in Hellas, Jewish chiliasm in the Roman Empire, and the sectarian movements of a
Manichean (Albigensian) and Marcionite (Bogomil) hue. The Arab Caliphate, too, did not
escape the futurist effect (as it is most correctly called) when, from the ninth century
A.D., the Bedouins of Bahrain adopted the Karmathian ideological system and spread through
Syria, Egypt, and Iran. The Karmathians established a dynasty, the Fatimids, in Egypt, and
seized mountain fortresses in Iran (Alamut, Girdekukh, and Lumbasar) from which they
dictated their will to Muslim sultans and emirs. The Persians called them Ismailites and
the Crusaders Assassins.</p>

<p>The ideology of the Karmathians was frankly idealistic, but not religious. According to
their teaching the world consisted of two halves, mirror reflections of each other. In
this world it was bad for them, the Karmathians; they were oppressed, humiliated, and
robbed. In the anti-world everything was the opposite; they, the Karmathians, would
oppress, humiliate, and rob Muslims and Christians. One could only pass to the anti-world
with the aid of the 'living god' and of teacher-elders appointed by him, to whom it was
necessary, of course, to submit and pay money. There was nothing religious in this system.
The striving to represent the teaching of the Karmathians as an ideology of struggle of
the oppressed against feudal lords reflects only one aspect of the matter, and not the
most important one. The Fatimids in Cairo and Hassan Sabbah in Alamut were exactly the
same kind of oppressors of the peasants as their opponents, although they sometimes made
use of social contradictions in the interests of their policy. And indeed, could a band or
sect express the interest of the broad masses?</p>

<p>In ancient China, however, the futuristic perception of time that was manifested 'in
the third century A.D. led the people to the people to the uprising of the 'Yellow
Turbans'. In addition to the real class contradictions during the later Han dynasty (A.D.
25-220), Taoist scholars had been expelled from all posts in the state service by
Confucianists, and forced to earn their living by treating illnesses and forecasting the
weather. This wretched existence did not suit them; they created a theory that 'the blue
sky of violence' would be succeeded by 'the yellow sky of justice'. In fact the sky turned
red from the reflection of spilled blood. In the period of troubles that succeeded the
uprising, the population of China fell from 50 million to 7.5 million. It would be
frivolous to blame Taoist propaganda alone for all the calamities, since the overwhelming
majority of those involved in the events were foreign to any philosophical conceptions.
From my angle it is only important to note the existence of a futuristic perception of the
world and its activation with the decline of the backward-looking view, dislodged, as it
were, from the life of the people. It is not by chance that the third century A.D. is
considered the age dividing ancient China from mediaeval. A new accumulation of values,
both ideological and material, began in the sixth century A.D. under the Sui dynasty, and
took shape in a backward-looking trend in the seventh century during the Tang dynasty.
N.I. Konrad called this phenomenon the Chinese Renaissance, when under the slogan of
'return to the ancient' a new, original culture was created that was opposed to moral
decay and to the brutality of the soldier and nomad kingdoms of the epoch called the
'Five Barbarians.' <a name="ebe2text9"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note9">[+9]</a></p>

<p>One might conclude that a futuristic perception of time is encountered so rarely that
it is an anomaly. That is wrong; it is as regular as the two others, but operates in an
ethnic association so destructively and disastrously that either the ethnos as a whole or
the 'dreamers' die, or they declare their dream fulfilled and become actualists, i.e.
begin to live like everyone else. The futuristic perception of the world is dangerous for
those around only in pure forms and high concentrations. Mixed with others it is capable
of arousing sympathy. Johann of Leyden in Mьnster, for example, knew how to fan a high
pitch of passions, and the bloodshed inevitably associated with that phenomenon. But
contemporary Baptists are narrow-minded, and as such are closer (in the system of
classification I have adopted) to bigoted Catholics, Protestants, and atheists than to
their own ideological and spiritual forebears. In other words profession of an idea does
not determine attitude to time and is not linked with it. The pattern of 'futurism' is
that the presence of people of this stamp starts a process of ethnic disintegration; and
since these processes are observed in all the periods we have studied, the disappearance
of ethnoi is obviously not an accident or a matter of chance, any more than the appearance
of new ones is. Both are parts of one and the same dialectical process, ethnogenesis; and
if, as people, we may sympathize with some one mental attitude or mentality, as scientists
we must simply define the relation and vectors of the constituent magnitudes in the
general trend of the movement being studied.</p>

<p>Past-worship, actualism, and futurism reflect three stages of the ethnic dynamics but
there must be, in addition, and actually is, a frame of reference of the category of time
corresponding to the static state of the ethnos. It consists in the very ignoring of time
that I have already described. Time does not interest people of this stamp because they
derive no benefit from contemplating it for the activity that nourishes them. There are
such people (that I called narrow-minded or Philistines above) in all stages, but they are
hardly noticed when other categories exist. When all their rivals disappear with the
triumph of 'futurism' or 'obscurantism', indestructible mediocrities emerge from the
cracks and fissures, historical time comes to a halt, and the land lies fallow.</p>

<p>So I have closed all the lines of my analysis, and obtained confirmation of a
hypothesis of a four-member construction of ethnic becoming. That is not a chance
coincidence and not an arbitrary construct, but a reflection of the essence of the process
of ethnic disintegration. But if my analysis has exhausted the theme, then not only
ethnology but also ethnoi themselves would long ago not have been, because they would all
have disintegrated with the passing of historical time. Obviously there are creative
processes of intraethnic evolution, in addition to destructive ones, thanks to which new
ethnic associations arise. The ethnic history of mankind therefore does not cease, and
will not, as long as there are people on Earth. Because an ethnos is not an arithmetical
sum of human units but a system, a concept that must be unraveled in detail.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="center">Ethnos as a System</h4>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>'System' in a popular explanation.</strong></font> </i>A
well-known example of a social system is the family living in one home. The elements of
the system are the members of the family and the objects of their way of life. These
include the husband, wife, mother-in-law, son, daughter, house, well, and cat. They
constitute a household so long as the spouses are not divorced or separated, the children
have not broken away, the mother-in-law has not quarreled with the son-in-law, the well
has not become covered with scum, and the cat has not had kittens in the loft. If they
stay in the house after that then, whether a water main is laid or the well is cleaned, it
will not be a family, but a settled plot, i.e. all the elements of animate and inanimate
nature will remain in place, but the system of the family will disappear. If, on the
contrary, the mother-in-law dies, the house is rebuilt, the cat runs away, the favorite
son leaves to study, and so on, the family will be preserved in spite of the changes in
the number of elements. That means that the objects are not the really substantial,
operative element of the system, but rather the connections are, although they have
neither mass, charge, nor temperature.</p>

<p>This inner link between separate people with mutual dissimilarity is a real
manifestation of a systems link and cannot be defined by any other indicators.</p>

<p>The relations in a system can be both positive and negative, some of the links of the
subsystem being able to change sign during an individual's life. Let us continue my
example. The relation of a newborn boy with elders has a certain tendency and 'weight'. <a name="ebe2text10"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note10">[+10]</a> They take care of him, bring him up, and teach him. On
becoming an adult and the father of a family, he does not, however, break his relations
with his elders. But the sign of the connection changes to its opposite; he cares for his
parents and teaches his children. Finally, having become an old man, he again requires
care and attention. This pattern indicates that no system is static but is in mobile
equilibrium (homeostasis), or in motion from a push of some kind whose impulse lies
outside the system. It is not excluded, of course, that this impulse is limited for a
system of higher rank, but the mechanism of influence is not altered.</p>

<p>The family is a graphic example of a system. But more complicated systems like, for
example, an ethnos, social organism, species, geobiocenosis, are governed by the same
regularity, even when allowance is made for their being constructed on a hierarchical
principle, in which the subsystems form a systems entity (supersystem), and the
supersystems a hypersystem, and so on. The existence of universal, general connections
that create dynamic stereotypes is thus more or less stable, but never eternal.</p>

<p>The degree of stability of an ethnos, as a system, is thus determined not by its mass,
i.e. the size of the population, and the accuracy of its copying of ancestors, but by a
mean statistical set of connections of various weights and signs. A sharp departure beyond
definite limits entails either death or rapid development. The elasticity of an ethnos is
created by that, which makes it possible to absorb and dampen external influences and even
sometimes regenerate itself, because a multi-link system makes up for the damage from the
reorganization of connections.</p>

<p>Let me pass from this popular explanation to scientific definitions, i.e. cybernetics
and systemology on the scale that we shall need them.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>'System' in ethnology.</strong></font> </i>The
American scientist Norbert Wiener defined cybernetics as the science of control and
communication. The merit of cybernetics is the method of investigating complex systems,
since it gives no advantages in the study of simple systems. The object of study of
cybernetics is the modes of behavior of an object. It does not ask 'what is it?' but
rather 'what does it do?'. Cybernetics is concerned with all forms of behavior, in so far
as they are regular, or determined, or reproducible. Materiality is of no significance for
it, nor observance or non-observance of the ordinary laws of physics. </p>

<p>The theses cited indicate that for an ethnologist, who interprets the essence of the
phenomenon of ethnos and recognizes laws in order to tie his own observations up with
them, absolute confidence in the methods of cybernetics is counter-indicated. Application
of cybernetic methods can serve as a corrective for the extrapolation of empirical
generalizations, but no more. Therefore it is not the ideas of Wiener but those of
Bertalanffy, who combined physical chemistry and thermodynamics with cybernetics, that
will usefully underlie the methods of systems study of an ethnos.</p>

<p>According to Bertalanffy's approach, <a name="ebe2text11"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note11">[+11]</a> a system is a
complex of mutually interacting elements, i.e. the primary elements of information are the
connections between facts and not the separate facts themselves. According to A.A.
Malinovsky,</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">a system is built up from units whose grouping has independent
  significance, and from links, blocks, and subsystems, each of which is a unit of a lower
  order that provides the hierarchical principle that makes it possible to carry on
  investigation at a given level. <a name="ebe2text12"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note12">[+12]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Starting from that principle we have the right to treat an ethnos as a system of social
and natural units and the elements inherent in them. An ethnos is not just a crowd of
people similar in certain features to one another, but a system of individuals different
in tastes and capabilities, and of the products of their activity, traditions, the
geographical environment, ethnic surroundings, and tendencies to increase or diminish. The
trend of development is particularly important because</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">the general, for all cases of sets, is the property of elements to
  possess all forms of activity that lead to the formation of static or dynamic structures. <a name="ebe2text13"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note13">[+13]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The application of this approach to processes of ethnogenesis is also linked with the
solution of the problem of historicism, since all the observed facts are built up into a
dynamic system of historical development. It only remains for me to analyze that part of
World History that is directly connected with my theme.</p>

<p>We can thus define the real existence of an ethnic entity as the dynamic existence of a
system that includes not only people but also elements of landscape, cultural tradition,
and relations with neighbors. <a name="ebe2text14"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note14">[+14]</a> These are not only the
biological system, and not only the social one, because analogues of the biological and
the social levels are not justified. The original charge of energy in such a system is
gradually expended, and entropy continually increases. A living substance or system must
therefore constantly remove the accumulating entropy, exchanging energy and entropy with
the environment. This exchange is controlled by regulating systems that employ the stocks
of information transmitted by inheritance. In our case the role of regulating systems is
played by tradition, which interacts equally with the social and natural form of the
motion of matter. Transmission of experience to progeny is observed in most warm-blooded
animals. But the existence of tools, speech, and writing separates man from other mammals,
and an ethnos is a form of collective being inherent only in man.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Levels and types of ethnic systems.</strong></font> </i>The
approach I have adopted allows me to substitute ethnic systematics for ethnic
classification. A classification can be made according to some arbitrary attribute
(language, race, religion, kind of job, citizenship). In any case it will be an arbitrary
division not inherent in the nature of things. But systematics reflects precisely the
latter, studying humanity and technique and domestic animals as a definite object. The
biggest unit, after mankind as a whole (as an amorphous anthroposphere, one of the
envelopes of Earth), is the superethnos, i.e. a group of ethnoi that has arisen at the
same time in a region and which manifests itself in history as a mosaic unity of ethnoi,
i.e. of directly observable taxa. They, in turn, are divided into subethnoi, i.e. into
units that exist only because they are part of the unity of the ethnos; without the ethnos
they fall to pieces and die.</p>

<p>Membership of a category of taxonomy is determined not by the absolute identity of the
individuals, but by how far they are similar in a certain aspect at a given level. At the
level of the superethnos (let us take the Middle Ages as an example), Muslims (Arabs,
Persians, Turkomans, Berbers) were closer to one another than to members of the
West-Christian superethnos (the 'Franks' as all the Catholics of Western Europe were
called). On the other hand, the French, Castilians, and Scots who were part of the general
superethnos were closer to one another than to members of other superethnoi (Muslim,
Orthodox, etc.). At ethnos level the French were closer to one another than to the
English. That did not prevent the Burgundians from supporting Henry V and taking Joan of
Arc prisoner, although they understood that they were going against their own. In any case
one must not reduce the whole variety of visible history to awareness of ethnic unity,
which is only <i>sometimes </i>the main factor determining a person's behavior. But there
is <i>always </i>such awareness, along with other factors, which provides for classing it
as the nature of man, as an invariant, rather than among variants of the historical
process. In other words, however mosaic an ethnos is, and however varied its structure, it
is a unity at a given level.</p>

<p>It is very interesting that historians are already groping for the possibility of such
an approach. They involuntarily group ethnoi into constructs that they call either
'cultures' or 'civilizations' or 'worlds'. For the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, for
example, we find real sense in concepts that were then perceived as actually existing
entities. Western Europe, for example, which was under the ideological suzerainty of the
Pope and the formal, but never in fact realized suzerainty of the German Emperor, called
itself the 'Christian world'. The West Europeans thereby counterposed themselves not only
to the Muslims they were fighting in Spain and Palestine, but also to the Orthodox Greeks
and Russians, and also, surprisingly, to the Irish and Welsh Celts. Quite obviously, it
was not a religious community that was understood by that, but a systems unity that was
given its name by an arbitrarily accepted indicator.</p>

<p>The 'World of Islam' equally counterposed itself to the Greeks and Franks, and the
pagan Turks, but from the angle of religion it was not a unity. The doctrines of the
Shiites (theists), Karmathians (atheists), and of the Sufis (pantheists) had very little
resemblance to each other, or to the orthodox doctrine of Islam (Sunnism). The Christian
Europeans, too, were by no means friendly with one another, but when clashing with Muslims
or pagans, they immediately found a common language and ways of compromise. That meant,
for example, that Venetians could fight Genoese, but only until Arabs or Berber Muslims
appeared; then the former enemies threw themselves against the common enemy.</p>

<p>We know from history that fierce wars were often waged between close relatives. But
they differed radically from the wars at the level of major systems. In the latter case
the enemy was regarded as someone foreign, interfering and liable to destruction while
personal motives (anger, hatred, envy, etc.) were not a reason for the brutality
exhibited. The further systems are from one another, the more cold-blooded the mutual
extermination is, being converted into a kind of dangerous hunt. Can one really hate a
tiger or a crocodile?</p>

<p>On the contrary, the struggle within a system has the aim not of exterminating the
enemy but of victory over him, since the system cannot exist without its component parts.
The leader of the Florentine Ghibellines, Farinata degli Uberti, for instance, helped the
enemies of his city win, but did not permit the destruction of Florence. He declared that
he was fighting the city in order to five in it. He lived there until his death, after the
Arbia ran red with the blood of his enemies the Florentine Guelphs.</p>

<p>But that was still nothing. The Venetians dealt far more severely with Alberigo, the
brother of the famous Ghibelline Eccelino da Romano. When he yielded up his castle near
Treviso in 1260, six of his sons were killed before his eyes, and then he himself was
beheaded, and his wife and two daughters burned alive on the square of Treviso. Why were
such senseless cruelties inflicted?</p>

<p>To understand that situation one has to grasp that 'Guelphs and Ghibellines were
algebraic signs that could conceal meaning.' <a name="ebe2text15"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note15">[+15]</a> It is
considered that the Ghibellines were feudalists and the Guelphs burgesses (burgbers), but
a number of towns were half-and-half for the Ghibellines, and some Guelphs became
Ghibellines, and vice versa, and it happened that the two parties acted together against
the Arabs or Greeks. Such big urban republics as Genoa and Venice passed repeatedly from
one camp to the other, guided only by political considerations. So why did blood flow?</p>

<p>The means of maintaining unity of a system depends on the epoch, or rather on the phase
of ethnogenesis. In young systems the elements make very intense contact, passionate so to
say, which causes clashes. The bloody discords often have neither ideological nor class
sense, occurring within the limits of one social stratum, like Wars of the Roses in
England, or the war of the Armagnacs and Burgundians in France. But these intestine wars
maintain the unity of the ethnic system and state better than when the population is
apathetic, when it would seem easier to live, but the ethnoi break up and disappear as
entities.</p>

<p>Ethnic systems are often not equivalent to state formations. One ethnos may live in
different states or several in one. So in what sense can we treat them as systems?</p>

<p>It is acceptable to divide systems into two ideal types: rigid and corpuscular, or
discrete. In rigid systems all the parts (elements) are so fitted to one another that
their simultaneous existence is necessary for normal functioning. In discrete systems the
elements interact freely and easily replace analogous ones, without the system ceasing to
work; and it is even possible to drop some elements with the next renewal. If that does
not happen there is a simplification of the system that may go so far as to destroy it.</p>

<p>Another division of systems is possible - into open ones constantly receiving energy
and exchanging positive and negative entropy with the environment, and closed ones that
use up original charge until their potential is balanced with that of the environment.
Four variants are possible when these two characteristics are compared: (1) rigid open;
(2) rigid closed; (3) discrete open; (4) discrete closed. The division is arbitrary,
because any operating system combines features of different types, but since it is close
to one pole or the other, the division is justified in practice, because it helps classify
systems by the degree of subordination of the elements.</p>

<p>When we study history, both constitutional, social, and cultural, and ethnic, we come
up against all the gradations of systems of the types described, with the exception of the
extremes, i.e. only rigid or only discrete, because neither the one nor the other is
viable. Rigid systems cannot be self-restorative when they break down, while discrete ones
lack the capacity to withstand blows from outside. We therefore encounter systems in
practice with various degrees of rigidity, which is the higher the more human labour is
involved in it, and the lower the more creation of the system is initiated by natural
processes that constantly transform the elements composing it. The limit is the opposition
of the technosphere and the biosphere.</p>

<p>But where is the boundary of the biosphere and the technosphere, if the human organism
itself is part of nature? Obviously the boundary of the socio-technosphere and the
biosphere runs within human bodies as well as outside them. But the difference does not
disappear because of that. On the contrary, we are seeking a real element of the
interaction of the social and biological here. It is that independent, and quite
well-known phenomenon of nature, viz., the ethnos.</p>

<p>Ideally, an ethnos is a discrete system but so as not to be annihilated by neighbors,
it immediately develops social forms that are auxiliary rigid systems: the authority of
the elders in the clan, for example, the chief in the hunt or war, obligations in regard
to the family, and finally, the formation of a state. The rigid systems are thus
socio-political formations like the state, tribal unions, clans, bodyguards, etc. The
coincidence of systems of both types, i.e. of ethnos and state or tribal union, is not
obligatory, although it seems natural. Recall the great empires of antiquity that united
diverse ethnoi or the mediaeval feudal splintering of ethnoi. A propensity to combine is
as natural as one to coincide. The systems of both types are dynamic, i.e. they rise and
fall in historical time. Homeostatic ethnic systems in which changes are, connected only
with external effects seem to be the exception. But one must not forget that homeostasis
arises only after intense development, when the forces creating and driving the system run
out. Statics should therefore be perceived as slow inertial motion with a limit - zero -
that is not reached in practice.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 align="center">Subethnoi</h4>

<p align="center">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The structure of an ethnos.</strong></font> </i>Its
structure √ an inseparable feature of an ethnos √ is always more or less
complex, but it is this complexity that gives it the stability by which it has a chance to
survive centuries of confusion, troubles, and peaceful wasting away. The principle of
ethnic structure is, one may say, a hierarchical subordination of subethnic groups (the
latter understood as taxonomic units within the ethnos, as a visible whole, and not
disrupting its unity). At first glance this thesis contradicts my proposition about the
existence of an ethnos as an elementary entity, but remember that even a molecule of
matter consists of atoms, and an atom of elementary particles, which does not ablate
statements about the entity at one level or another (molecular or atomic, or even
subatomic). The whole thing is characteristic of structural connections. Let me explain
this from an example.</p>

<p>A Karelian from the Tver Province called himself a Karelian in his village but on going
to study in Moscow a Russian, because it made sense in the village to counterpose
Karelians to Russians, but in the city it did not, since the differences in way of life
and culture were so insignificant as not to be visible. But if he were a Tatar, rather
than a Karelian, he would go on calling himself a Tatar because the past religious
difference deepened his ethnographic dissimilarity from Russians. But a Tatar living in
Western Europe or China would be considered a Russian, and would himself agree with that;
in New Guinea, however, he would be seen as a European, only not of the tribe of the
English or Dutch. This example is very important for ethnic diagnosis, and so for
demographic statistics and ethnographic maps. For when such maps are being compiled it is
absolutely necessary to agree on the order and degree of approximation, otherwise it will
be impossible to distinguish the subethnoi that exist as elements of the structure of an
ethnos, from current ethnoi.</p>

<p>Now let me touch on the subordination of ethnoi. The French, for example, a clear
example of a monolithic ethnos, include, as I have already said, Breton Celts, Gascons of
Basque origin, Alsatians, descendants of Alemanni, and Provencals, an independent people
of the Romance group. In the ninth century A.D., when ethnic names were first recorded in
documents, the French, all the peoples named above, and others, too √ Burgundians,
Normans, Aquitaines, Savoyards √ still did not constitute a single ethnos, and only
after a thousand-year process of ethnogenesis was the ethnos formed that we call the
French. The merging, however, did not cause a leveling of local customs, rituals, etc.
They were maintained as provincial peculiarities that did not disrupt the ethnic wholeness
of the French.</p>

<p>We see the results of ethnic integration particularly clearly in France, because the
course of events during the Reformation led to the French Huguenots being forced to quit
their homeland in the seventeenth century in saving their lives, they lost their former
ethnic affiliation and became German nobles, Dutch burghers, and a large number the Boers
who colonized South Africa. The French ethnos shed them, like a superfluous element of the
structure, diverse even without it. France, as a socio-political entity, however, was not
weakened, but on the contrary consolidated. The fields and orchards abandoned by the
zealous Huguenots passed to indifferent people, who restored an economy in the eighteenth
century that no longer suffered from internal wars. The ethnic monolithism arising enabled
Napoleon to mobilize the population and create a very numerous and obedient army, after
whose defeat France did not break up, in spite of all the survivals of provincial
separatism.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Self-regulation of an ethnos.</strong></font> </i>It
may seem strange that I ascribe a capacity for self-regulation to an ethnos. But an ethnos
is dynamic in historical development and consequently, like any long-lasting process,
finds solutions within its power to maintain its existence. Others are cut off by
selection and die out. All living systems resist extinction, i.e. are anti-entropic, and
adapt to external conditions in so far as that is possible. But as soon as some complexity
of structure raises the resistance of an ethnos to external blows, it is not surprising
that where it was not sufficiently mosaic at birth, as for example in Great Russia in the
fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, it begins itself to throw up subethnic formations,
that sometimes take shape as estates. <a name="ebe2text16"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note16">[+16]</a> On the southern
borders Cossacks emerged, in the north Pomors. <a name="ebe2text17"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note17">[+17]</a> Subsequently
they were augmented by 'prospectors' (at first glance, simply a kind of job) <a name="ebe2text18"></a><a href="ebe2a.htm#ebe2note18">[+18]</a>;
peasants followed after them, mixing with the aborigines of Siberia and forming a
subethnos of Siberians. In the course of history these subethnic groups dissolved into the
main mass of the ethnos, but at the same time new ones were thrown up. </p>

<p>It is very easy to distinguish subethnoi because the ethnography of the end of the
nineteenth century worked precisely at that level. Russian ethnographers studied everyday
customs, i.e. a fixed stereotype of the behavior of a group of population that differed
sharply from those of the capitals (Moscow and St. Petersburg). They studied the life of
the Olonets peasants (in Karelia), for example, but not of the professors of the colleges
in St. Petersburg,</p>

<p>In short, subethnoi are obvious because, on the one hand, they are within an ethnos
and, on the other, their bearers differ from all others in manners, mode of expressing
feelings, and so on. They arise through different causes, coincide sometimes with estates,
but never with classes, and disperse relatively painlessly, giving way to others,
outwardly dissimilar, but with the same functions and fates. The purpose of these
subethnic formations is to support ethnic unity by way of internal, non-antagonist
resistance. This complexity is obviously an organic detail of the mechanism of the ethnic
system and as such arises in the very process of the formation of an ethnos or of
ethnogenesis. When an ethnic system is simplified, in the phase of decay, the number of
subethnoi is reduced to one. That marks the persistent (residual) state of the ethnos. But
what is the mechanism of the rise of subethnoi? To answer that we have to go to a lower
order in which there are taxonomic units that I divide into two sections: consortia and
convicinities. Small tribes, clans, and the already mentioned corporations, local groups,
and other associations of people are put into these sections.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Consortia and convicinities.</strong></font> </i>Let
us agree on terms. I call groups of people united by a common historical fate consortia.
They include 'circles', cooperatives and workers' guilds, sects, bands, and similar
unstable associations. They usually break up, but sometimes last for several generations.
Then they become convicinities, i.e. groups of people with both a way of life of the same
character and family connections. They are not very resistant. They are eaten away by
exogamy and reshuffled by succession, i.e. by sharp changes of historical surroundings.
Undamaged convicinities grow into subethnoi. Such were the Russian prospectors mentioned
above, consortia of desperate, foolhardy explorers who gave rise to a generation of
staunch Siberians; and Old Believers. The first English colonies in America were founded
by consortia and were converted into convicinities. New England was founded by Puritans,
Massachusetts by Baptists, Pennsylvania by Quakers, Maryland by Catholics, Virginia by
Royalists, Georgia by supporters of the House of Hanover. Consortia sailed from England
that were not reconciled either to Cromwell or to the Stuarts, and on the new soil, where
the old disputes were not pressing, they became convicinities that opposed themselves to
new neighbors √ Indians and French.</p>

<p>The Russian prospectors and Old Believers remained part of their ethnos, but the
descendants of the Spanish conquistadors and English Puritans formed special ethnoi in
America; so this level can be considered the limit of ethnic divergence. And, one must
note, the oldest tribes were obviously formed in former times by this means. An original
consortium of energetic people is converted into an ethnos in conditions of isolation,
which in early epochs we call a tribe.</p>

<p>Ethnology finishes with consortia at the ordinal level, but the principle of
hierarchical subordination can operate even further if necessary. At a lower order we get
the single individual, connected with his surroundings. That can be useful for the
biography of great men. Going down further we encounter not the full biography of a person
but an episode of his life, for example, a crime committed that should be disclosed; and
even lower, chance emotion, which does not entail major consequences. But we have to
remember that this endless dividing, which is in the nature of things, does not remove the
need to find a unity at a given level, important for tackling the task posed.</p>
