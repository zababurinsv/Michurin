<h3><a name="sik1para01">1. Overcoming the Study of Letters</a></h3>
<h4>On Reading Books</h4>
<p>When your interest is aroused in some subject, when you want
to know all about it - what it represents, how it is linked with its
surroundings and what significance it has for me and my contemporaries - you
look first of all for a suitable book where all this might be described. You
hope that, reading it, you will find peace and be able to pass to other matters
until the demon of curiosity again seizes your heart.</p>
<p>And so, I admit, I wanted terribly to know how the mighty
empire of Chinggiskhan suddenly arose in the desert steppes of Mongolia and,
after a century, just as rapidly disappeared. Of course, I immediately set about
finding a book, but what was my disappointment: there were more books than I
could read in my entire life, but all the same there was no answer to the
question.</p>
<p>It may be objected that I have no right to make such an
assertion, since I admit that I have not read all the books. Fortunately, we
have inherited something from medieval scholasticism - the system of footnotes
and references. In reading a wide-ranging work, we can easily establish from the
references what has been taken from where. The authors of such works are precise.
If they could note from somewhere or other valuable information which would
throw light on the cause of the rise of a world empire, they would have done so.
Unfortunately, there is no such source, and I had to dig into the texts myself.</p>
<p>Yet there, too, disappointment lay in wait. The authors of
some sources tell us that there was a large Christian kingdom in Asia prior to
the rise of the Mongol Empire, but the authors of other sources from the same
period are silent about this. I was totally lost. To satisfy my terrible
curiosity I had to undertake a serious study of nomad history, putting all other
matters aside.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{4} </font></b>History is a delicate matter,
though. If you simply gather information from various sources, it is usually
contradictory. If you select only those items which agree with other information,
they scatter like a pyramid of ball-bearings. They have to be bound, cemented,
but there is nothing to do it with. Then I thought: let us take the conclusion,
known to be correct, that Chinggiskhan lived and his Empire existed and that
legend or supposition, known now to be dubious, that Prester John ruled in the
&quot;Three Indias&quot;, and compare them and see what happens. Straightaway an
organic conception results from such a combination, since there will be both
positive and negative values. That is what I did. Now, let the reader judge how
successful my attempt has been.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>An Authentic Lie</h4>
<p>In 1145 a rumour ran through Western Romano-German, feudal
and Catholic Europe shaking the imagination of kings and prelates, knights and
merchants, noble ladies and fair courtesans, coarse provincial barons and the
sailors of the Mediterranean fleets of Genoa, Venice and Pisa - in a word, of
all who had even an indirect connection with the Second Crusade, then being
prepared.</p>
<p>Otto of Friesing, the outstanding German historian, author of
a world chronicle, <i>De duabus civitatibus, </i>and of the <i>Gesta Friderici
imperatoris </i>(Barbarossa), left the following record: &quot;We also met the
recently anointed Bishop of Gabul from Syria. He said that a few years ago a
certain John, king and priest of the people living beyond the Persians and
Armenians in the extreme Orient, professing Christianity, though of the
Nestorian persuasion, marched in war against the two Samiard brothers, kings of
the Medes and the Persians, and conquered their capital, Ecbatana [?!]...
Victorious, the said John moved forward in order to come to the aid of the Holy
Church. However, when he reached the Tigris and, for lack of boats, was unable
to cross it, he marched north where, he had learnt, this river freezes over in
winter. But spending several years there without avail, without the frost, and
failing in his aim because of the warm weather, he was obliged to return to his
native land, the more so since because of the bad climate he had lost many of
his soldiers... Apart from this, they say that he is descended from the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{5}
</font></b>Magi&quot; <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text1"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note1">[+1]</a></font>
(i.e. the Magi of the Evangelist, who allegedly saw the star over Bethlehem and
brought gifts to the new-born Jesus).</p>
<p>Similar information also appeared in other German chronicles.  <a name="sik1text2"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note2">[+2]</a> Evidently,
the information about the king-priest began to be regarded as genuine. New
details were added to the legend: Prester John's letter to the Byzantine Emperor,
Manuel Comnenus, appeared, apparently written in Arabic and then translated into
Latin for the Pope and for the Emperor Frederick Barbarossa. The Arabic original
has not been preserved, but the version of the text which has reached us is as
follows (in abbreviated form):</p>
<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>Prester John, by Almighty God and the Authority of our
    Lord Jesus Christ King of Kings, ruler of rulers, wishes his friend, Manuel,
    Prince of Constantinople, health and prosperity by God's mercy...  <a name="sik1text3"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note3">[+3]</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>This address alone may put the reader with any critical
ability on his guard. John calls his vassals kings, but the sovereign lord
Manuel Comnenus he calls Prince of Constantinople. Such obvious lack of respect,
totally without cause, would have been followed, not by alliance and friendship,
but by the breaking off of diplomatic relations. But the author of the letter,
the forger, knew his audience. In the Catholic West the humiliation, even
imaginary, of the Orthodox Emperor of Byzantium was accepted as something that
went without saying and did not involve any distrust of the text, but would have
simply helped matters.</p>
<p>Prester John goes on to describe his kingdom which he calls
the &quot;Three Indias&quot; and names his capital as Suza. Only a reader
totally ignorant of ancient geography could fail to notice that the author of
the letter himself understands nothing of it.</p>
<p>Of course, in Constantinople they paid not the slightest
attention to this cock-and-bull story; but it never entered the head of the
twelfth-century West European reader that the wool was being pulled over his
eyes.</p>
<p>It is highly noteworthy that &quot;Prester John&quot;
considered it his duty to describe all the living creatures of his kingdom,
beginning with the most exotic animals from the point of view of a European: <b><font COLOR="#943634">{6}
</font></b>&quot;elephants, dromedaries, camels, <i>meta
collinarum </i>(?), <i>cametennus </i>(?), <i>tinserete, </i>panthers, forest
asses, white and red lions, white bears, white whitings (?), cicadas, eagle
gryphons, ... horned men, one-eyed ones, men with eyes back and front, centaurs,
fauns, satyrs, pygmies, giants, cyclops, the phoenix and almost all sorts of
animals which dwell on earth ... &quot;  <a name="sik1text4"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note4">[+4]</a></p>
<p>Where did the author of the letter take this list from? Only
from medieval phantasies, since this genre never died. It is absolutely
astonishing that this nonsense was believed, and continued to be so, for more
than five hundred years, but such is the power of the word included in an &quot;authentic
source&quot;, and that was what the letter was. That was why, on 27 September
1177, Pope Alexander III gave a long missive to the physician-in-ordinary,
Master Philip, for the &quot;king-pontiff John&quot;. The emissary and the
letter were despatched from Venice immediately. But where to? The location of
the extensive and great Christian kingdom in the Far East was unknown and all
attempts to find it were unsuccessful. It could not have been otherwise - the
kingdom of the eastern Christians did not exist.</p>
<p>The Europeans were long unwilling to come to terms with their
disappointment, but they were obliged to. Neither in India, nor in Abyssinia,
nor in China was anything found similar to John's kingdom which had been
described in such detail. In the nineteenth century it only remained for
historians to explain the reasons for the forgery and for the credulity of their
ancestors. Yet even now historical critical method does not always differ in
principle from that of the middle ages; moreover, both truth and falsehood are
always mixed together, though in different proportions.</p>
<p>There is no smoke without fire, and there is now no doubt
that the cause of the rumour was an actual event: the defeat of the forces of
the Seljuk sultan Sanjar by the levies of the Central Asian tribes, united under
the Khitan Gurkhan Ye-lu Dashi, on the plain of Katwan in 1141.  <a name="sik1text5"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note5">[+5]</a>
Probably there were Nestorians among the nomads, yet if Ye-lu Dashi had a
particular religious sympathy, it <b><font COLOR="#943634">{7} </font></b>was
only to Buddhism. His forces did not reach the Tigris, they did not attempt to;
his kingdom was small, encompassing only the land of the Seven Streams [Southeast
of Lake Balkhash - trans.], part of Dzungaria and the southern slopes of the
Altai; John's name has not been established among those of the Khitan lords, nor
has anything been found in Asia similar to the luxuriant inventions of the
medieval Europeans.  <a name="sik1text6"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note6">[+6]</a>
So we immediately have two big problems: (1) what was there really? (2) since an
authentic source gives information known to be false, have we the right to trust
our sources in general, and, if not, how are we to get reliable information? It
is these two questions that we are trying to answer in this book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Difficulties Arising</h4>
<p>Fortunately, our predecessors have done no mean work on the
history of the middle ages. This is to be understood in the sense that the
sequence of most events in political history has been established; wars,
treaties, diplomatic and dynastic alliances, laws and social reforms have been
dated. In other words, we already have a canvas which may be embellished in
various ways and used to contradict or cast doubt on information the absurdity
of which strikes one in the eye - including the tale of the &quot;pontiff-king
John&quot;.</p>
<p>But there are also so many events that it is impossible to
see them at a glance or to recall and retain them in the memory. It is usual
here to proceed by means of narrow specialisation, studying a single country in
one comparatively short period. Yet it was this path that led the medieval
chroniclers to accept the absurd information about John, information which was
not retained in the arsenal of Byzantine and old Russian scholarship because
Greeks and Russians, closer to Asia, knew it better than did contemporary
Germans or French. Consequently the path of narrowing specialisation results in
the researcher being blinkered, and a lack of perspective leads to no fewer
faults than lack of depth.</p>
<p>Our theme, then, demands the widest sweep of history in the
lands where Nestorianism arose, developed and perished, i.e. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{8}
</font></b>almost a thousand years in the history of Asia from
the sea of Marmora to the Yellow Sea. To bear in mind all the events relating to
our concerns is only possible if we locate them in a system specially adapted
for this purpose. Since there is no such system, we have to invent one, at the
same time remembering that its purpose is purely to be an aid.</p>
<p>The material we require to reach a conclusion may be obtained
in two ways: (1) directly from the sources, i.e. the writings of those
contemporary to the events, and (2) from summary histories of the nineteenth and
twentieth centuries. The second method has a number of advantages: it is less
burdensome; the medieval texts and versions have already been criticised and it
makes no sense to do this again unless it is called for; events have been
marshalled in causal and sequential series and this eases our task of
interpretation, and, finally, the reader can without difficulty follow the
course of our reasoning and check whether our conclusions are correct. Alas,
however, we must not limit ourselves in this manner, for if everything was as
fortunate as this in historiography, problems such as we have encountered, and
will encounter again more than once, would not have arisen. Thus, we shall be
obliged to turn to the sources again and again, not from the point of view of
textology or an examination of the literature, but to check the reliability of
that information giving rise to doubts or distrust. The language or literature
student of the sources strives to answer the question: what does this author say?
But the history-student of the sources is interested in different questions:
what is true of that which the author tells us, what has he left out and how
were things in actual fact? The difference is obvious.</p>
<p>There is a very widespread view that error or inadequacy in a
conclusion is accounted for by superficial study of the source. This implicitly
supposes that the sources available to scholars contain all that is needed for a
complete knowledge of the subject. One has only to translate with the utmost
accuracy the work of a medieval author and retell it in one's own words for any
problem connected with the work to be resolved. This view is nowhere specially
formulated, but it exists as an assumption of something obvious and not subject
to review. This leaves out of account that the historian blindly following the
sources merely reproduces the ancient author's viewpoint, not the true position
of the matter, which was often unclear to the ancient author himself. In such an
approach, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{9} </font></b>criticism
of the sources amounts to establishing their authenticity; but the
contradictions of several undoubtedly authentic sources form a barrier not
always overcome. However could it be overcome when it is recommended, say in our
case, that we should reject all modern and ancient research on the history of
Mongolia and translate afresh the Arab, Persian, Greek, Chinese, Mongol, Latin,
Georgian and Armenian sources without repeating a single one of our predecessors
and, finally, put forward another hypothesis with no certainty that it will be
better than the former ones?</p>
<p>This path did not attract me, primarily because I could not
summon up the courage to declare that my translations (were I to do them) would
be better and more accurate than those made by the most brilliant and learned
specialists. On the contrary, the historian, having his own point of view, will
always go for the translation confirming it. It does not matter at all whether
he consciously selects the variants that suit him, or honestly believes that
that is how things were. Even striving to be more literal is not expedient; a
literal translation is far from always the most exact one, since it leaves out
nuances of sense and tone which signify much more in a literary work than verb
forms or turns of syntax.</p>
<p>The main fault of this method, though, is that research into
the subject is replaced by study of the texts dealing with it. What interests us
is the Nestorian problem, not what contemporaries wrote about it.</p>
<p>Facts extracted by criticism from a source rarely allow us to
make out the course of events, because many important events are always omitted
in the sources, while insignificant ones are overemphasised. The Old Testament
can serve as an example. If we read nothing else, we cannot doubt that the whole
history of the Near East in the first millennium B.C. revolved around Israel and
Judea. In fact, as we now well know, Israel and Judea were the back of beyond in
the Near Eastern world whose historical fate was at this time determined by
quite different peoples and states.</p>
<p>In just the same way it follows from the &quot;Song of Roland&quot;
that Roland's heroic death in unequal battle with the Moors was the chief event
in Charlemagne's first campaign in Spain in 778. But we know that, in general,
there was no such battle and that Roland in fact was killed by the Basques, not
the Moors, in the gorge at Roncesvalles. Yet such a blatant distortion of events
does not prevent the &quot;Song of Roland&quot; being a first class historical
source, just as <b><font COLOR="#943634">{10} </font></b>it
does not prevent the &quot;Lay of Igor's Host&quot; being such, although Prince
Igor's campaign against the Polovtsy in 1185 described in it took place in quite
a different way than is depicted in the &quot;epic&quot;.  <a name="sik1text7"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note7">[+7]</a></p>
<p>Therefore, an analysis is essential and this is expediently
done by means of a synchronic selection of the facts, so that it is easy to
disclose exaggerations and omissions in the sources, as well as gaps in the
general picture. The latter can be filled only by interpolation, filling in the
rough outline of events drawn from the sources with the help of causal and
sequential links.  <a name="sik1text8"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note8">[+8]</a>
With the interpolations, naturally, exactitude is reduced, but the allowance to
be made is not great and the general line is not violated, but in the opposite
case it is quite lost. The subsequent operation is synthesis: the comparison of
the historical outline obtained with analogous series of facts similarly
established in contiguous fields of study. Synthesis means establishing
similarities and dissimilarities and explaining both, which is the aim of the
research.</p>
<p>Thus, our chain of methods has four links: (1) how (was it
written)? (2) what (was it really)? (3) why (did it take place in that way)? and
(4) what was the point? - the final product of the work.</p>
<p>I hasten to add in order to forestall a possible - no,
inescapable - criticism based on a failure to understand my approach fully. I am
not against translating old texts again, I even favour it, but I consider it an
inexcusable luxury not to take account of what precisely such heavy and complex
work may bring. It varies. Repeated and parallel translations are extremely
desirable for elegant literature. Every translator transmits the aesthetic,
stylistic nuances and shades of meaning he notices. Here no duplication can
arise, because an artistic translation always differs from the original and from
an analogous translation, especially one made several generations earlier. Here
language, too, as a system of associations and reflexes, is significant, and we
know that our forefathers spoke, even if only a little, yet somewhat differently
from ourselves.</p>
<p>Translation of business affairs is a different matter. Here,
if terminology is not involved, style changes neither sense nor meaning.
Whatever expressions were used to describe the defeat, let us say, of the
Russians on the river Kalka, the fact will not be altered and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{11}
</font></b>the dead princes will not be resurrected. Such a
translation is good enough for our analysis, and we should restrict ourselves to
such to be able to weigh pros and contras impartially.</p>
<p>As for terms (names of ranks, clans, military forces,
toponyms, ethonyms etc.), in uncovering them the language specialist will be
unable to help the historian unless the latter is able to feel his own way,
relying not on the etymology of individual words, but on the complex of events
in descriptions of which these difficult words are found in different contexts.
That is why we shall look at the problem of &quot;Pope John&quot; not as a
problem of texts, but as one of twelfth-century historical reality for which the
question of Oriental Christianity, however odd it may seem, is crucial.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>On the Track of Research Routes</h4>
<p>The question of how to write a &quot;history&quot; has not
been resolved, and never will be. Moreover, there is no need for a solution
because prescriptions in this case will do more harm than good. It is quite
impossible to imagine that two contemporary researchers working on a single
period, even if in complete agreement in interpreting the events and evaluating
the phenomena, would treat the subject in identical fashion, since each would
pay more attention to the subjects closer to his academic interests. It is this
variety which aids objective perception of the historical process which arises
before the reader in various perspectives and, thus, more fully.</p>
<p>The form, style and language of a historical account is
determined by the author's intended audience: scholarly specialists, or the
general reader interested in the research subject. In the first case an
extremely detailed analysis of complex problems, for which the author suggests a
solution, is necessary; the account of the course of events is reduced to a
minimum, since it is known to specialists; and dry, business-like language is
characteristic, since the focus is on the proof and the history of the problem.
Such a book is, in essence, nothing but an extended article.</p>
<p>In the second case, the author devotes more attention to
historical synthesis, relying on analytical works by means of footnotes. There
is no purpose in repeating the arguments of the articles cited since this
deprives the reader of following the author's line of thought. An account of the
development of events becomes decisively significant, because that is where, as
in a telescope, the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{12} </font></b>sense
of the period as a whole is focussed. Graphic, sometimes emotional, language is
permitted.</p>
<p>Finally, a third approach is possible: that of the handbook.
By no means all sections of history are equally well known to readers, including
historians themselves. History has so expanded in extent and in depth in the
twentieth century that the historian of, let us say, the Italian Renaissance is
only an educated reader as regards the history of India or China. This is felt
particularly severely in dealing with subjects such as ours. There is an
enormous specialist literature in many languages on nomadism, but there are no
general, simplified summaries from which one might extract the necessary
information without trouble. But, then, this is the main thing: easy access to
positive knowledge which allows us to concentrate the forces saved on the
subject under consideration.</p>
<p>Even a thousand years ago the problem of surplus information
occupied the best historical minds which, in a number of cases, have not been
surpassed. Constantine Porphyrogenitus, encountering this difficulty, wrote:
&quot;the material of history has grown immensely and insurmountably; therefore,
the aim of the work is to combine extracts from writers old and new&quot;. In
this way he wanted to say that what was important to him was, first, to
establish the fact, and it did not matter from which source the author took it;
and, second, to establish the links between this fact and others, i.e. to find
its place in the chain of events. It was this that he considered the subject of
history, and he regarded the rest, i.e. historiography, as a subsidiary and not
always necessary occupation.</p>
<p>Yet, before writing the history of a country or a people, you
have to have a view of it, and you can view it in different ways: with a bird's
eye view, from the summit of a hillock, or from a mouse hole. In each case we
see something and lose something, but it is impossible to combine all three
views. So, we have to choose the one we need at a particular moment.</p>
<p>Thus, in historical analysis it is best to make use of all
three methods, since no one of them deserves preference, but simply answers
various questions. The approach proposed here is simply analysis, i.e. the
&quot;dismemberment&quot; necessary to disentangle obscurities in history, and
then to proceed to synthesis when the results of various methods of research are
taken into account. Only in this way can we break free from the Procrustean bed
of the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{13} </font></b>established
scheme without falling into a study of trivialities in which the object of the
research - the rhythm of world history - becomes lost.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Now for Synthesis</h4>
<p>We observe the night sky with a telescope, a woman's profile
with the naked eye, an insect with a magnifying glass, a drop of water in a
microscope. But how do we observe history? Regrettably, the greater part of
useless arguments have taken place because some wanted to see historical
processes reduced, let us say, by 1,000 times, others with a magnification of
perhaps 850, naively supposing that in this say some approximate average would
be arrived at. Is this not the origin of the age-old argument between methods,
schools, approaches etc.? Imagine that we have at our disposal a historyscope,
an apparatus with a scale showing the degree of approximation. Let us set the
eye-piece at approximation no.1 (the most general).</p>
<p>We will see an enormous spiral, the path of historical
development. Its lower end is lost in dense forests fringing the tongues of an
advancing glacier, in caves where tall, swarthy men have divided a mammoth
carcass, cutting up the meat with flint knives. Below, the strands of the spiral
become diffuse and only separate fragments can be seen with the dim outlines of
hominids: Neanderthal, Sinanthropos, and other examples of nature's handiwork.
The upper end passes into the future which appears to us as the complete triumph
of man over nature, but I shall not undertake to describe it, leaving that to
the writers of science fiction. Our written history is merely one strand in this
gigantic spiral.</p>
<p>At the first approximation we see three strands in the
pattern of man's general history: a demographic explosion, technical progress
and the change of social and economic formations. Population growth over the
past thousand years follows a rising curve. At the start of our era the earth's
population amounted to 250 to 350 million. At A.D. 1000 it amounted to about 275
million; in 1650 about 545 million; in 1800 approximately 906 million; in 1900
1,600 million; in 1950 2,517 million and by 2000 it should reach 6,000 million.
Moreover, it has been noted that population growth is particularly great not in
countries where there is an abundance of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{14}
</font></b>produce, but where there are shortages.  <a name="sik1text9"></a><a href="sik1a.htm#sik1note9">[+9]</a>
We evidently have here not a function of the growth of civilisation, but an
immanent law natural to mankind as a species.</p>
<p>Technical progress on such a time-scale is undoubted. It
extends beyond the framework of social relations and becomes a factor in the
anthropogenic transformation of earth's landscape. Entire species of animals
have disappeared and continue to do so; cultivated plant species, for example,
wheat, potatoes, coffee, are spreading, displacing the natural geobiocenosis.
Fresh water is being polluted by industrial waste, even the atmosphere begins to
change its composition. Progress is like fire, it both warms and burns. Social
progress has been described in adequate detail and there is no need to repeat it.
The study of these rhythms is an achievement of the method of world history. In
relation to these patterns, the cultural historical school is powerless. It
simply does not observe them, since its range is narrow.</p>
<p>Let us move the eye-piece to approximation no.2. The spiral
is at once lost, only one of its twists remains, about 5,000 years long, which
will be perceived as a straight line. But the line is intermittent, as though it
consists of interwoven strands of different colours the ends of which pass
behind one another. These are those historical cultures which continually
replace one another, co-existing for centuries on the surface of the planet.
Thus, the dawn of Hellas when the <i>basileis </i>and their retinues destroyed
Troy, the twelfth century B.C. , coincided in time with the decline of Egypt and
the beginning of the fall of the might of the Assyrian Kingdom and Babylonia.
Thus, the banners of the Frankish knights and the emblems of the Mongol warriors
were raised at the death throes of golden Byzantium, the thirteenth century.
When, in the seventeenth century, medieval China, as a result of internal crisis,
became enfeebled, the throne of the Manchurian bogdo-khan was raised high and
Eastern Asia united around it. Each of these upsurges was linked with the
phenomena of ethnogenesis, the appearance of new peoples as a result of the
fundamental transformation of earlier ones. Here it is impossible to talk of a
single process. On the contrary, the interweaving of different processes with
their own momentum of development is to be seen: a rapid rise, a brief
stabilisation at the zenith and a gradual decline, beyond <b><font COLOR="#943634">{15}
</font></b>which there sometimes followed the complete
disappearance of that ethnos. It was about such phenomena that Ibn-Khaldun and
Giambattista Vico spoke.</p>
<p>Let us move the lever of the historyscope to approximation
no.3, and we see only one culture, passing through its youth, maturity and old
age. A picture of social struggle arises before us. In Ancient Rome there was
the struggle of patricians and plebeians, then of the optimates and populares,
later of the Senate and the legions. In Italy this will be the struggle of the
Langobards with the local population, later transformed into the struggle of the
Ghibellines and Guelphs and, finally, into the wars of the Italian towns with
one another. In Mongolia this will be the war of Chinggiskhan's retainers
against the tribal leaders of the Kerait, Merkit and Naiman. In the Arab
caliphate the competition between Qaisites and Kalbites was succeeded by the war
between `Abbasids and Omayyads, then of the Khorrami against the Muslims and
finally the Turks against all the rest. But each culture will be seen separately,
all the rest will be merely background, explaining individual events in
political history, but not its proper rhythm.</p>
<p>With approximation no.4 we see not the entire history of a
culture as a whole, but only an individual period. Social contradictions become
enhanced and the characters and fate of individuals distinct and prominent. Then,
the historian will speak of the ungovernable nature of Marius, of Sulla's iron
will, Pompey's levity, Caesar's prudence, Antony's amorousness and Octavian's
caution. History will seem an arena for the competition of the great, although
we know the very idea is deceptive. The period which we looked at as the basic
and final end of our study with the last approximation will become a background.
Yet this is still not the limit.</p>
<p>Approximation no.5 remains possible, and with this one man is
in view. Strange though it may be, this approximation is very often used. If
this man is Pushkin, Pushkin studies will arise, if Shakespeare,
Shakespeareology. Here history borders on the genre of biography and ceases to
be itself. The scale of the history-scope is exhausted.</p>
<p>This is the solution to which analysis of the material of
world history has brought us in answer to the question posed at the beginning of
this work: how are we to understand the history of the Kingdom of Prester John
against the background of World History? What approximation answers to our aims
and how should we use it?</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{16} </font></b>Approximation no.1 clearly is
not to be used because the century of interest to us will seem a point on an
infinitely long curve. And we know it is impossible to describe a point because
it has location in space, but no form. Apart from that, the methods applied with
the first approximation, such as: the formation of major races (negroids,
europeoids, and mongoloids), the discovery of fire, the invention of writing,
the use of metal and so on, embrace periods with which the appearance of a false
rumour, such as that which concerns us, can by no means be compared.</p>
<p>Let us turn to approximation no.2. Here there is something to
look at. The twelfth century shows a wonderful interweaving of distinct cultures,
dissimilar from one another and avoiding similarities even in the form of
borrowings. Western Europe, politically disunited, perceives itself as a unity,
a whole, calling itself Christendom, which excludes the schismatics: the Greeks
and the Russians. The same picture in the lands of Islam: political
fragmentation is no hindrance to a cultural unity which counterposes itself to
that of the &quot;Franks&quot;, the Greeks and the &quot;faithless Turks&quot;,
which covers all the nomads of Eurasia, including the Hungarians and the Mongols.
In the twelfth century China was centralised, but regarded the kingdoms of
Tangut - Xi-xia, and of the Khitan-Liao, as its periphery. This was clearly
stretching a point, since the Tangut were more drawn to Tibetan culture and the
Khitan preserved many traditions of a nomad way of life, but that was the
Chinese attitude, confident in China's superiority to all people in the whole
world. What of the nomads themselves? Where they were not Sinicized, converted
to Islam, or had become a feudal Catholic kingdom, as, for example, in Hungary,
they remained themselves and, like all the cultures listed, had a sense of their
own unity against a background of political and everyday variety. This is the
background for our theme; but what sort of picture is it, if it has no
background and depth?</p>
<p>With approximation no.3 we get to our subject in earnest. The
fate of Nestorianism as a particular branch of the culture we may conventionally
call Byzantine (for the word Byzantium is a conventional term); the medieval
Greeks of Constantinople called themselves <i>romeioi, </i>i.e. Romans),
followed from beginning to end, would make much clear to us, and our theme would
be only part of it. Yet then we would be obliged at the same time to raise
questions which would distract us from our problem, so it is sensible to pass to
approximation no.4 and to review only one period, from 1141 to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{17}
</font></b>1218 when the Nestorian khanates were conquered by the
Mongols of Chinggiskhan.</p>
<p>It would seem that we have found a solution, but,
unfortunately, there is a stumbling block in our way: the sources for the
history of the twelfth-century Nestorian khanates are too meagre. Only a few
chance mentions have survived; it is impossible to reconstruct the course of
events and give an explanation based on them. That is why history has failed to
illuminate this problem; but we shall attempt to find a way out of a seemingly
hopeless position.</p>
<p>Let us take the &quot;panoramic&quot; method. Let us collect
and systematise all that took place before, after and around the &quot;dark spot&quot;,
i.e. let us take approximation 3.5 as an aid; then, on the basis of the
established facts, let us look at the stimuli to the behaviour of individuals
taking part in the events; this will be approximation 4.5. If we get no results
even with this method, which has not so far been used, we shall give up. But
while there is hope of success, let us begin the investigation.</p>
