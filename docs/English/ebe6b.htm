<h4 align="center">The Phases of an Upsurge of Drive</h4>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The birth of an ethnos</font></i><font COLOR="#ff0000">.</font></b> The
simplest version of the beginning of ethnogenesis is the rise of a new ethnos on
the background of a described static state that cannot alter of itself. (1) None
of the members of the ethnos want such a change; (2) none of them can even
imagine it; (3) in order to change the character of the process a powerful,
purposive energy impulse is needed that no self-awareness can create because
that would contradict the law of the conservation of energy. Nevertheless ethnoi
do arise from time to time. Let us see how.</p>
<p>Several ethnoi with different systems of economy and a different culture five
alongside one another in one territory. They are habituated to each other; there
are constant but insignificant conflicts between them and, as a rule, these pass
without marked consequences. Since the fluctuations occur within quite regular
limits there is homeostasis.</p>
<p>But now the population of the region passes into a dynamic state, i.e. begins
to develop. The first stage of development is a breaking of the established
relationships, like an explosion. That always happens as follows: a certain
number of persons appear in one or two generations who are not resigned to the
limitations that their grandfathers willingly put up with. They demand a place
in the sun corresponding to their talents, energy, feats, and successes, but not
previously accorded them, and determined only by accidents of birth in some one
family. The first of them perish because the collective resists them, but if the
process goes on long enough, there proves to be a sufficient number of these
hothead, desperate, foolhardy, reckless malcontents to rally and impose their
will on people of the old disposition. The foundation of the old temple rests on
the bones of martyrs and victims. So it was with the founding of Rome, when the
Latin emigrants gathered on the seven hills for war with the kings of Alba Longa;
such were the 'faithful' of the robber-shepherd David, who united the remnants
of the twelve much battered Jewish tribes in a strong kingdom with a centralized
authority, religion, and ethnic self-awareness. In both cases the slaveowning
formation was preserved. The above-listed did not differ in any way from the
companions of Muhammed, the Mohajeers and Ansars, and the Zulus, the heroic
soldiers of Chaka, Dingaan, and Cetywayo, and the Matabele on the banks of the
Zambezi. To them all were similar not only the war bands of the Vikings but also
the barons of the early Carolingians, Charlemagne's counts, and the knights who
were the prototypes of the literary images of the knights of the Round Table;
they after all also broke with the accustomed way of life and regarded that not
as a sin but as a feat.</p>
<p>Here is a brilliant example of drive and change of the ethnic stereotype of
behaviour. In the twelfth century the Great Steppe was inhabited by various
peoples whose social life was regulated by tribal and clan norms and standards
of life that had arisen after the disintegration of the military-democratic
formations, the hordes. More than half of the nomads professed Nestorian
Christianity, but the Mongols in Transbaikalia and Eastern Mongolia had their
own religion. In this initial condition there gradually took place a process of
the isolation of so-called 'men of long will' from the tribes, i.e. of those
with most drive who did not accommodate themselves to tribal life. At first they
sought sustenance in the hills and steppes, but inevitably had to resort to
robbery, and then their death was decided in advance. Later they began to form
small bands, and finally rallied around Temujin, an impoverished member of the
noble clan of Borjigins, who had been orphaned at the age of nine. In the second
half of the twelfth century Temujin, thanks to skilful, artful diplomacy and
organizing talent, succeeded in creating first a small horde and then uniting
the whole Great Steppe up to the Urals, and in reconciling the tribes conquered
by force of arms to his authority, so that they took part in distant campaigns
on equal terms with the Mongols.</p>
<p>The direction of their dominant was suggested by the need to react to an
extremely difficult and all the time worsening situation. The Chinese and
Central Asian Muslims were behaving toward the Turks and Mongols in the same way
as the North American colonists did toward the Indians. The Chinese and Muslims
systematically attacked the nomads with the aim of physically exterminating them,
sparing only the small children, whom they sold into slavery. Therefore the
nomads, guided by clan categories of blood feud and collective responsibility,
had an instinctive but conscious need to fight the aggressors.</p>
<p>The steppe, united by Temujin, proved strong enough, answering blow by blow,
to defeat their perennial enemies and (what is especially impressive) Christians
and pagans acted hand in hand. The later campaigns of Genghis-khan's heirs were
provoked by exceptionally hostile acts by the Chinese national Sting Empire, the
splinter groups of the broken Khorezmites of Jelal ud-din, the Russian dukes who
took the side of the Kipchaks (Polovtsy), and the Hungarians, who wiped out a
Mongol embassy. The Mongols kept part of the conquered lands thanks to the fact
that there were groups among the local population who considered an alliance
with the Mongol khans salutary for themselves. Such were the Armenians in the
Near East, who were under pressure from Muslims, and Alexander Nevsky in Russia,
who was defending the Russian land against Catholics (Swedes, Germans, and their
allies). The vast territories and diverse populations could not constitute a
single whole, and broke up into several states in which the local population
gradually assimilated the small bands of Mongol conquerors, creating new ethnoi
with a different social system and a different culture: the Tatars of the Golden
Horde, i.e. the Volga urban population, of various tribes, of course, united by
loyalty to the Genghisite khans; the steppe Nogai in the west and the eastern
nomads united in Kazakh tribal unions (juses); the Uzbeks, Oirats , Buryats, and
remnants of the Khalkha Mongols and Berguts.</p>
<p>These examples of' the rise of an ethnic system are clear because they are
simple. The cruel drought of the tenth century A.D. depopulated the Great Steppe
for a century, which was peopled again during the next moistening of the arid
zone in the eleventh century. The process of readaptation led to an increase in
the population of the steppes but not to integration of it. Only a drive impulse
rallied the isolated tribes of the Pacific maritime taiga and the Transbaikalian
steppe into two powerful creative ethnoi, the Jurchens in the cast and the
Mongols in Transbaikalia. Integration proceeded relatively easily since it arose
on the basis of a homeostatic state of the primordial ethnic substrata. The
expansion of the new ethnoi was resisted in the main by foreigners. In spite of
their immense preponderance in number and technique they were defeated. That
does not mean, of course, that victory of the Mongols was preordained, because
the Aztecs and the Zulus suffered defeat in similar situations. The Mongols
simply knew how to exploit the opportunity for victory, but that is already not
ethnogenesis but political history.</p>
<p>The case is rather more complicated when a new dynamic state arises not from
a static one but from a dynamic one that has already covered a considerable
stretch of evolution. Such a situation occurred in the first century A.D. when,
on the limes of the Roman Empire, at the junction of the Hellenic, Hebrew, and
Syrian ethnoi there arose a population equally similar and equally foreign to
all those listed above. This was a Christian community that gave 'unto Caesar
the things that are Caesars', did not distinguish in its milieu between Greek
and Jew, and was hated by everyone around it because its ethnic dominant was
foreign and incomprehensible to them.</p>
<p>From the tiny Christian community of the first century A.D. arose later the
huge ethnos and culture we call Byzantine. The mechanism of the forming of the
Christian ethnos differs outwardly from those considered above, but wits
identical with them in essence <a name="ebe6text30"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note30">[+30]</a>.
The preachers and martyrs, apologists and contemplators, behaved just like
Roland who died in the gorge of Roncesvalles, Leonidas of Sparta at Thermopylae,
and many other heroes. The tactics of behaviour were changed, but the
psychological pattern was the same, and also the results ñ the creation of a
new collective of people with an original culture, i.e. a new ethnos that three
hundred years later, having supported the leprous tyrant and murderer
Constantine, gave him victory and the diadem, contenting itself only with
getting the right to legal existence. And then, front A.D. 313, the new ethnos 'Romaic
Christians' became fact of' world historical importance.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The upsurge of drive. </font></b>The 'dynamic' phase of ethnogenesis is
always linked with expansion, just as heated gas expands. The Byzantine
Christians were no exception. But preaching monks rather than soldiers and
merchants carried their invincible energy beyond their i native land. Egyptian
hermits had already in the third century A.D. left the Thebaid and gone
preaching in the west through pagan Rome and Druidic Britannia to the green
island of Erin whose inhabitants never knew Roman despotism and civilization.</p>
<p>In the fifth century A.D. an independent Christian church arose in Ireland
that categorically did not recognize either the Pope of Rome or the western
Church calendar, because their tradition had been brought from the east where a
new formation ñ Byzantium had arisen.</p>
<p>The Byzantine ethnos had no ancestors. That does not mean, of course, that
the people who comprised it were not descended from <i>Pithecanthropus</i>, but
an ethnos is not a stock of people but a dynamic system arising in historical
time, with an impulse of drive as a necessary component in the initial moment of
ethnogenesis, a process that smashes an old culture.</p>
<p>In the Mediterranean there was a single Hellenistic culture in antiquity that
had absorbed in the process of its development Latium and the Phoenician cities.
Ethnically it resembles the WestEuropean because the main Hellenic core did not
exhaust all the variants of the diverse Hellenistic culture. Rome, Carthage, and
Pella, of course, had their own local features and were independent ethnoi, but
in the superethnic sense came within the orbit of Hellenistic culture. There is
nothing new in that, incidentally, but it is important for me as a starting
point. Roman domination encouraged ethnic levelling but the equalizing of Greek
and Latin led to almost the whole population of the Mediterranean merging into
one ethnos. But in the first century A.D. new people appeared in the Roman
Empire who formed a new entity in the next two centuries. They counterposed
themselves to the 'pagans', i.e. to all the rest, and in fact distinguished
themselves from them by the character of their behaviour. Obviously the common
denominator was not an ideological or political attribute, but an ethnological,
i.e. a behavioural one, which was really new and unaccustomed for the
Hellenistic culture. It was foreign to the Jews, too, incidentally, who had not
by any means merged with the Romans and Greeks, but were not persecuted for
their faith.</p>
<p>Members of the Christian communities constituted the nucleus of the 'Byzantine'
ethnos, and how that came about we shall now see.</p>
<p>In A.D. 330 the Emperor Constantine transferred his capital to the little
town of Byzantium and converted it into luxurious Constantinople. People with
drive flowed there from all over the place. Many Goths settled in Thrace on the
pretext of service in the armies. Slavs broke the Danubian line of
fortifications and settled in the Balkan Peninsula, including the Peloponnese.
Syrians were spread from the valley of the Po to the bends of the Huangho. By
the sixth century a multi-lingual, multi-tribal but monolithic ethnos had been
created to which I arbitrarily attach the name Byzantine. Greek ñ a heritage
of antiquity ñ was only the state and generally accepted language, but at home
everyone spoke his mother tongue. Very soon this 'Byzantine' ethnos became a
superethnos because its charm conquered Armenians and Georgians, Isaurians and
Slavs, Alans and Crimean Goths.</p>
<p>The history of Byzantium has been interpreted either as a continuation of the
history of the Roman Empire (Gibbon), or as the creation of a Christian 'Greek
Empire' (Uspensky, Kulakovsky), or as an East-European version of the feudal
formation. All these aspects illuminated various aspects of Byzantine history,
but the problem of the originality of Byzantine culture remained unsolved. My
point of view also does not pretend to a universal description of Byzantium as
an entity, but it fills a lacuna in the ethnic history of Europe.</p>
<p>I shall give the name 'Byzantium' to the phenomenon that arose after the
impulse of drive of the first and second centuries A.D. in Palestine, Syria, and
Asia Minor, which took shape as a church, with all its deviations and currents,
and found a stereotype of relationships with the secular authorities. This
integral entity was much broader than the boundaries of the Eastern Roman Empire
and survived it by many centuries. One may dispute the title, but it is not
worth the trouble, because it is comprehensible and settles the problem by a
posing of the matter that is constructive for further argument and discussion.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Second Rome or Anti-Rome</font></i><font COLOR="#ff0000">?</font></b> If we
were to describe the descending limb of the curve of ethnogenesis, the task
would be easy. We would establish a progressing simplification of the
ethno-social system, a lowering of its resistivity and infiltration by foreign
elements. But when we have to describe the ascending limb, then it is much more
complicated. With mounting drive the dominant is not found immediately. Certain
directions of development begin, struggling more fiercely with one another than
with their natural opponent, the departing traditions of the dying superethnos.</p>
<p>But, in spite of that, all resisting systems operate the same as regards the
previous one, even when they take on its defence. Julian the Apostate tried to
restore the Roman faith, and replaced Christ by Mithra. But Mithraism was a
religion as foreign to the Romans as Christianity; these religions penetrated
Rome at the same time, under Nero; the devotees of Mithraism were not the Roman
nobili but the Illyrian soldier emperors; and mainly legionaries torn from their
homes and native lands, and more often foreigners, were initiated into Mithraic
mysteries. Even if Julian had been victorious and had rooted out Christianity,
he would have consolidated, not the posterity of the god Quirinus and the
she-wolf, but a system that would be more correctly understood as Anti-Rome,
only in another style than that created by the Christian communities.</p>
<p>They worked away gradually over three centuries, uniting elements with drive
that had fallen out of the decrepit system, which did not give them an outlet in
creativity for their unruly passions. The Christian communities were the most
impulsive force in the Empire.</p>
<p>But since the Roman Empire was a single cultural-social political entity,
even with the administrative division in 'East' and 'West', regional populations
with both drive and sub-drive coexisted in it that exchanged entropy and
negative entropy with one another. In other words, bearers of the tradition of
the antique decline of morals lived side by side with vigorous myth-creators,
initiators of new traditions. Territorial division would have been good for
them, but there was nowhere for them to go, because Rome so offended the
surrounding ethnoi that they began to detest all Romans. That is why the
superseding of one ethnos, the Roman, by another, the Byzantine, took place over
the whole territory of the Roman Empire and was such an agonizing process.</p>
<p>Therefore one can only arbitrarily suggest a date as the 'beginning' of the
new process of ethnogenesis and the first phase of its formation.</p>
<p>In the middle of the first century A.D. the preaching of the Apostle Paul
laid the beginning of consortia that had not yet emerged from the initial ethnic
substrata, but the Romans already saw some sort of entity in them, though they
perceived it as a variety of Judaism.</p>
<p>In the middle of the second century, thanks to the activity of St. Justin
Martyr, the Christians emerged as a special subethnos categorically dissociated
from Judaism; contemporaries counted the gnostics as Christians.</p>
<p>In the early fourth century the Christians were an ethnos within the Roman
superethnos that Constantine was forced to recognize. Nevertheless, the Eastern
Roman Empire created by him was not yet Byzantium in the ethnological sense of
the term; it should rather be understood as a field of the rivalry of Church
Christianity and the Mithraists, Neoplatonists, Donatists, Arians, and other
subdivisions of the new ethnic element being created before the eyes of the
historian and becoming obvious to contemporaries.</p>
<p>Once the warlike, and later on freedom-loving ethnoi of the West, after their
conquest by the Romans, supplied brave horsemen and skilled archers to the
legions, but by the fourth century A.D. even that was finished. Everything was
swept away by irreversible processes of 'drive entropy. Not only the
Gallo-Romans and the Britons, but also the Batavians, Frisians, Iberians, and
Numidians, in spite of the existence of personal qualities like courage,
physical strength, hardiness and endurance, etc., did not have the additional
quality that would have enabled them defend their property, families, and life
from enemies. The rich, cultured Alans behaved the same way on the eastern
frontiers of the region, which enabled them to be conquered by the savage, but
not numerous Hunni.</p>
<p>The 'last Romans', who were still encountered in blessed Italy, settled by
newcomer Asiatics, were the most craven of all.</p>
<p>The valiant Thracians and Illyrians had already squandered their drive in the
third century A.D. The mechanism of that was simple. Courageous, energetic
youths had joined the legions for 'careers and fortune', while the passive types
had started families in the homeland. So the extreme attribute was separated
from the population.</p>
<p>In the fourth century the most efficient and disciplined Roman troops
consisted of members of Christian communities. Even Julian the Apostate was
compelled to employ them. But they categorically refused to fight against their
fellow-believers for example the Bagaudae rebels in Gaul at the end of the third
century. Such principledness is sometimes inconvenient, but it made the
legionaries, brought up in the strict rules of the Christian communities, more
reliable than the demoralized citizens of the Roman world who did not believe in
Jupiter and Mars and had long ago lost any notion of fidelity and conscience.</p>
<p>It is a waste of time to try and find an explanation of the difference that
arose between the Eastern and Western halves of the Roman Empire in social
system. It had been quite unified already in the second century A.D. And (he
racial composition of file population could not have been of any significance
because tile inhabitants of Greece and Syria were already regarded in Rome in
the first century as degenerate descendants of once powerful ancestors. And that
was justified.</p>
<p>But in the fourth century the inhabitants of the towns, but not of the
villages, of the East took the initiative. Indeed, people with drive, oppressed
by the tedium of village life, gathered in the towns, The results of the impulse
of drive told in the same fourth century. In the place of citizens of the Roman
Empire, in Asia Minor, the Balkans, and Syria, where the new ethnos had taken
shape that I arbitrarily call Byzantine ñ barbarians were repulsed, a vast
city, Constantinople, was built, crafts were established, trade was organized
not only with neighbours but even with China, and ñ the main point ñ the
landscape of Syria, Asia Minor Thrace, and Macedonia was preserved. The
extensive economy obviously curbed to some extent the tendency to despoliation
inherent in migrants, who proved in Byzantium to be subject to existing laws and
customs.</p>
<p>Even in the capital of the Empire, Constantinople, in spite of its population
exceeding a million, nature was not annihilated. The city was buried in the
greenery of gardens, carefully watered, which fed the families of the
inhabitants. The Black Sea and the Sea of Marmora supplied the population with
fish; grain was imported from Egypt, where the soil was annually renewed by the
floods of the Nile, and from black-earth 'Scythia' (the steppes of the northern
coast of the Black Sea). It was proved that a culture could be created, crafts
developed, and magnificent structures erected without despoiling nature. That
was achieved because the surplus energy (drive) of the Byzantines was expended
on theological disputes and dissensions, which did them much harm, but were
harmless as regards the surrounding nature.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Decomposition and regeneration.</font></i></b> But everything happened
differently in the West. The development of engineering (roads, aqueducts,
gigantic galleys) made it possible to ensure supplies for the two-million
population of Rome. Grain was brought there from Sicily and North Africa, wine
from Greece and Provence, wool from Spain. Only fresh meat and flowers were then
not amenable to transportation, therefore Italy was turned into a pasture for
cattle, and plantation of violets, because ladies have always loved flowers.
Rome produced nothing, only consumed. But whereas the Roman officials in the
first and second centuries A.D. had known how to organize the exploitation of
the provinces and to reward their fleeced population by establishing a firm
order and certain rule of law (far from always observed), in the third and
fourth centuries it was no longer a matter of that. The soldier emperors
converted the country into an arena of civil war for power. And because the
legionaries had to be rewarded, there was a general confiscation of the rich
latifundists and squeezing of money from the poor landworkers. The latter in
turn ravished the land of the parcels , trying to subsist today, because it was
terrible and senseless to think of tomorrow's punishments. The population
steadily declined in numbers, and those who remained alive lost the will to
resist. It was not the vital forces of an ethnos but the social structure and
state traditions that held together the grandiose structure of the Roman Empire
at that time. It could not long continue.</p>
<p>The weakened West easily submitted to the booming East; after the last
attempts at resistance in A.D. 393-394, led by the Frank Arbogast, it was
converted into a periphery of Byzantium, already administratively formed into an
Orthodox empire. That measure was carried out by Theodosius and had most
important consequences: the ethnos formed on the ideas of Christ expanded so far
that it became a superethnos, and the currents of Christian thought became a
symbol of self-asserting ethnoi, hostile to centralized authorities, lay and
spiritual.</p>
<p>The Goths retained Arianism, condemned in A.D. 381 by the Oecumenical Council
of Constantinople. By that they distinguished themselves from the Byzantine
entity. The Berbers of Numidia supported the Donatists not even as heretics but
simply as schismaties ñ and Africa passed out of the hands of the Emperors of
Rome. But the descendants of the pagans of Gaul and Spain appealed to the
Oecumenical Church for the support and expected aid from the imperial
authorities ñ alas, without success. The East, too, lacked military forces.</p>
<p>In that super-difficult situation there lived, conquered, and died Actius
Flavius, son of a Roman and a German woman, who defended Gaul against the hordes
of the Huns and Germans, but was murdered by the Emperor Valentinian personally
during a business talk. Neither Aetius nor Valentinian had anything of the Roman
about them, but the former was courageous and clever, while the latter was an
envious take and lecher. There are various people in any superethnos, but there
proved to be more like Actius in the East than in the West. That is why vile
crimes, which were also frequent in Constantinople, did not ruin that city,
while Rome was sacked by the Vandals immediately after the death of Actius in
A.D. 455. If there had been real Romans there they would have defended their
Eternal City.</p>
<p>Some people suggest that 'the barbarians, having destroyed the Roman Empire,
did not annihilate the Roman people but merged with them'. Is that so? Look at
the demographic facts: in the first century A.D. the population of Italy was
seven or eight million, and around 600 A.D. four or rive million, a halving in
spite of the influx of Langobards, Heruli, Rugi, Goths, and immigrants from
Syria and Asia Minor, i.e. Christian Semites. It was the last-named who
constituted the bulk of the population of the towns of Northern Italy (Milan,
Verona, Padua, Ravenna, and Aquileia) when the Latin population of Italy had
been steeply reduced because the majority of the male population belonging to
the lower orders had served in the legions after the reforms of Marius and
returned so exhausted that they did not acquire families. The rich, the <i>nobili</i>
and the <i>equites</i>, had concubines from the slave women or went in for
unnatural practices. The Roman matrons, too, were not behind them in that. So
the almost halving of the population, together with the recorded immigration
from the north and the east, indicates a change of ethnos in Italy in the fifth
and sixth centuries A.D. The old ethnos disappeared and in its place an ethnic
conglomerate appeared.</p>
<p>When the Goths and the Langobards conquered the Apennine Peninsula, it was
sparsely populated. That is why they succeeded in subordinating it. I have dwelt
on this example in such detail so as to explain the whole complexity of the
problem of ethnogenesis, which cannot be answered without studying history.</p>
<p>It was not like that on the eastern frontiers of the former empire, where the
Christian stream proved viable and gave rise to an entity that had no name for
itself. On the basis of the early Christian communities (which had grown rapidly
by the fifth century A.D. over the whole extent of the Roman Empire and a number
of neighbouring countries) an ethnos was created that called itself by the old
word 'Romaic' (but I have already spoken about this in detail above). From the
sixth century Macedonia, Thrace, and the Peloponnese had been settled by Slavs,
the Epirus by Albanians, the south of Asia Minor by Isaurians, its centre by
Galatians, the north by Lazi (Georgians), the east by Assyrians, and Syria,
although it had a Greek substratum, but only in the towns, and it was not
numerous. The native Greek population held out for a longer time on the islands,
but Crete and Cyprus were conquered by Arabs in the eighth century, and their
Greek population was sold on the slave markets. So there remained the urban
population of Constantinople, which had a very motley population but employed
Greek as the generally spoken and literary language.</p>
<p>So, can one consider the Byzantine ethnos a continuation of the Roman or
Hellenic, although it had received a rich cultural heritage (languages with a
rich literature, towns with water mains, gardens, and fortresses on the
boundaries)? The new people used some of these goods; some they scorned, and
some they lost with sorrow. But the whole mood of the 'Byzantines' ñ Roman
Christians ñ was different than that of the Greeks and Latins. And the chief
thing is that, with the cardinal change of tire ethnic dominant, the system's
tense of drive grew and did not fall.</p>
<p>The new ethnos, which arose from Christian confessional consortia, displayed
an energy quite lost, it would seem, in the Roman Empire. This energy pushed
Egyptian monks of the Thebaid, and Syrian dogmatists from the banks of the
Orontes and Euphrates, to Ireland, India, Central Asia, and even China. It was a
spiritual-intellectual expansion, the more surprising that it was not supported
and reinforced by the force of weapons, and did not pursue any practical aims or
material interests. The reasons for this activity lay in it itself. It was an
act for the sake of the self-satisfaction of being aware of doing one's duty.
This sincerity affected the hearts of the people addressed, and ensured the
preachers of the new religion a success that immeasurably surpassed the actual
expenditure of energy from the preachers' high drive.</p>
<p>But within the Empire that same feature impelled people to religious disputes
that passed into political discord. Why was it necessary for a dispute about the
relation of God the Father and God the Son to entail bloody excesses that
yielded no real benefit for either the Orthodox or the Arians? On the contrary,
the Byzantines of the fourth to sixth centuries sacrificed economic and
political benefits for the sake of principles, most of which proved unviable and
disappeared.</p>
<p>But a certain part was preserved, and that seemingly the most valuable. These
were principles that antiquity had not known, that the Christian West did not
master, and that the Muslim East altered to its own key. Byzantium included
spiritual elements, especially conscience, in its constitutional system,
elements without which it was very difficult to build internal relationships,
and found means of combining them with the needs of the state. The state did not
lose by that.</p>
<p>Byzantium did not know the ulcer that corroded Western Europe, viz., the
struggle of the secular and spiritual powers. Beginning with Constantine the
Great, the emperor, on succeeding to the throne, received the rank of deacon I
hanks to which he could take part in Church councils and dictate decisions to
them that were considered binding because 'the emperor is the supreme master of
the creeds for the churches'. <a name="ebe6text31"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note31">[+31]</a> That put the Patriarch in second place, but gave
him opportunities the Pope of Rome did riot have. For the emperor wits not just
a sovereign autocrat but also a man, sinful and weak. The Patriarch, as
confessor, could impose a church penance on him, forbid him to enter a church,
refuse a marriage or a divorce. The emperor, true, commanded the army but it
could not go into battle without the blessing of the Patriarch. And if the
emperor had a bureaucratic administration, the Patriarch was obeyed by an army
of monks and theologians. The forces ñ spiritual and secular ñ
counterbalanced one another, so that the new ethnic entity was strong. But
culture?</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Overheating of drive.</font></i></b> Both trends of antique thought, the
natural philosophy that gave rise to Hellenistic geography, and the ethics of
the Socratics, Stoics, and Epicureans, had ceased to be actual for people who
believed in resurrection of the dead. Existence beyond the grave was considered
just as incontestable as real life; consequently a concern arose for saving
one's soul after death. That seemed more important than preserving the present
short life, because the afterlife was represented as eternal, and there was
practical sense in ensuring happiness for oneself in it. Eternal salvation from
the griefs and sorrows of the world was best ensured by a martyr's death, so
that some African Donatists, called 'circumcellions' (i.e. 'vagrant monks'),
formed bands of fanatics who, encountering a solitary wayfarer, would demand
that he kill them for the glory of Christ. A person could beg to be spared from
this obligation, because it was terrible for him, say, to kill even a chicken,
but they gave the unfortunate the choice of killing them or being killed
himself. For the circumcellions could commit any deed because a martyr's death
atoned all sins. And the poor creature was forced to take a cudgel from them and
bash their brains out in turn. And they died in expectation of eternal bliss.</p>
<p>That movement was wiped out by the persecutions of St. Augustine, the bishop
of Hippo Regius in North Africa.</p>
<p>In Syria and Egypt fanaticism took less acute forms ñ monasticism. People
subjected themselves to tortures, deprivations, fasting, and celibacy, for the
sake of eternal bliss. Those who stayed in the desert ñ hermits ñ did not
cause anyone trouble, but the vagrant monks, of whom there were many, were a
constant worry for the governors of the provinces, and even the emperors,
because they were afraid of nothing and no one, depended on no one, and acted
extremely impetuously by instinct, not always without harm for neighbours. This
was an extreme degree of drive that did not submit either to true reason or to
the force of circumstances. The monks therefore rapidly perished, but that was
what they wanted.</p>
<p>Fortunately for young Byzantium, the fanatics were in the minority for all
that. The leading role in the Church and state was taken by people with drive
but who had not lost their reason. For them, too, the doctrine of salvation was
important, but they wanted to understand it. While the Church was hunted and
persecuted, and Christians lived under threat of death, they stuck to each
other. But when they were permitted to profess their faith freely, it turned out
that its main principles were perceived and understood differently. And the
flame of drive, burning the hearts of people of that time, caused fires
quenchable by a now of blood instead of friendly disputes and talks.</p>
<p>From my standpoint, new consortia embodied in social forms should have
arisen, with the development and increase of drive, 300 years after the impulse
and by the end of the incubation period. In Byzantium these forms were sects
formed as the profession of certain theses in Christianity. In each sect there
was a nucleus of sincere devotees, an envelope of those who outwardly shared an
opinion and sympathized with it, and a milieu of indifferent people who used the
collisions for personal ends. The latter included almost all the emperors, with
the exception of Julian the Apostate, a sincere Mithraist. But Julian was a
subtle politician. fie did not carry out any religious persecutions, giving the
representatives of the various trends of religious thought full opportunity to
fight one another, but not against his power.</p>
<p>It will readily be noticed that neither the drive of monasticism nor the
masses of sub-drive could be employed for the needs of the state. But since the
position on the frontiers was extremely acute, the need for soldiers and
officials was great. They continued to take on foreigners for these duties, most
of all Goths, since they were rather more tactful than the Vandals, Gepidae and
Heruli.</p>
<p>Gothic youths willingly entered service in Constantinople, made careers up to
the rank Of general, and often carried out coups d'etat enjoying the support of
fellow-Goths. They also created natural consortia in the urbanized countryside
of the capital, adopted Christianity without fail, and joined some confession,
undoubtedly without going into the theological fine points, but knowing firmly
that their opponents were wrong in the supreme sense ñ why, the theologians
knew.</p>
<p>A counterweight to the Germans were the savage Isaurians, descendants of the
Cycladean pirates. Defeated by Augustus they had freed themselves from any
influence of the Roman authorities during the troubles of the third century, and
had resumed robbery and pillage on land and sea. Their savage courage assured
them careers in Byzantium, where one of their chiefs, Zeno, became emperor (A.D.
474-491), and another, Leo III Isaurian, founded a dynasty in A.D. 717. Being
rivals of the Goths, the Isaurians supported another creed, again irrespective
of its content.</p>
<p>At the beginning of the fourth century a dispute began in Alexandria between
the presbyter Arius, a learned and irreproachable man, and the Bishop of
Alexandria, who was supported by the deacon Athanasius, an ascetic and sincere
fighter for his convictions. They were not thinking about the Goths and the
Isaurians, but their dispute became a symbol of the struggle and an indicator of
the processes of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>Exactly the same craving for independence and originality was manifested by
Egypt and Syria with Mesopotamia. Here and there consortia arose with
confessional nuances and subtleties, the consequences of which determined the
history and cultural development of Asia and North Africa for many centuries.
But I must speak about the forming of the tension of force or drive in ethnic
refraction in more detail.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The poetry of concepts.</font></i></b> The need for knowledge and
understanding is no less strong than the need for food or a woman. It is more
variable, and is manifested in different people now as a craving for creation
and now as a thirst for blind faith, but it is always directly proportional to
drive, and its vector is determined by the presence of actual, pressing
problems.</p>
<p>In the fourth century Monarchianism, according to which Christ was God the
Father, and the doctrine of Paul of Samosata who taught that Christ was a man
inspired with divine wisdom, had already been rejected. But the question
remained. Presbyter Arius waged the polemic. He argued that Christ was file
divine Word incarnate (Logos), but since lie was the Son of God, there was
consequently a time when he did not exist. The Word was from the beginning but
was not everlasting; it was 'less' than the Father, because it had a beginning.
If the Word was not born, it meant that God the Father was not the father and
God the Son was not the son.</p>
<p>No, Bishop Alexander and Deacon Athanasius argued against Arius, the Father
and the Son co-exist, but the Son was born as a ray of light from the source of
light. The words 'Father' and 'Son' were just a metaphor; in actual fact the
Word was one person (hypostasis) of the Holy Trinity.</p>
<p>Let met make the problems more precise. Arius affirmed the likeness of the
Son to the Father, Athanasius the consubstantiality of the Father and the Son.
In Greek these words differ in only one letter. Was it worth killing so many
people for the sake of one letter over nearly three hundred years? Of course
not, but if they were killed it was not for the sake of it, and not because of
it, but simply under cover of it.</p>
<p>But the choice of excuse or pretext indicates that not only Church thinkers
but also the masses of illiterate people were capable of inscribing
philosophical symbols on their banners and going into battle under them. At that
time thought was respected.</p>
<p>The poetry of philosophical concepts drew the whole eastern half of the
Empire into its, circle. Both the learned clergy and the people took equal part
in the disputes. In A.D. 321 a council held in Alexandria condemned the teaching
of Arius. The Oecumenical Council in Nicea in A.D. 325 decided the matter in
favour of Athanasius. Arius was exiled, and his works burned.</p>
<p>In A.D. 335, the defamed Athanasius was exiled in turn, and a year later the
Emperor Constantine tile Great rehabilitated Arius, who then and there died,
either by being poisoned or from nervous shock. Nevertheless the Arians
triumphed at the Council in Antioch in A.D. 341. They were protected and
patronized by the Emperor Constantius. But, as always happens, the victors
quarreled. Some sought a compromise with the Nicean Creed, others went further
than Arius, demanding that all the dogmas be clear to reason, while another
group still proposed evasive formulations in order to avoid a reproach of error.</p>
<p>The Council of A.D. 359 in Rimini worked out the official doctrine of
Arianism. During the past period Goths, Burgundians, Vandals, and Langobards had
been baptized. They constituted the guard of Constantius, who ruled a very
turbulent country.</p>
<p>And the Niceans were exiled. Only the pagan Julian defended them, granting
freedom of religion so that file Christians would fight each other.</p>
<p>Only in A.D. 381 did the Spaniard I Theodosius convene the Second Oecumenical
Council in Constantinople, which anathematized Arians and Macedonians. <a name="ebe6text32"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note32">[+32]</a>
From that time on Arianism became the confession of Germans but not of Romans.
The philosopheme passed from the poetry of concepts into ethnology.</p>
<p>Conflicts sometimes arose on the soil of misunderstandings that had no
relation at all with underlying theological reasons, rather than on matters of
principle of dogmatics. In A.D. 430 Nestorius, born a Persian, a very strict and
learned man, became the Patriarch of Constantinople. Both aspects wounded tile
capital's clergy, who were not foreign to worldly temptations, against which St.
John Chrysostom had also struggled unsuccessfully in A.D. 397-404. In the
theological debate Nestorius had pronounced a phrase that was canonically
unimpeachable: 'God has no Mother'. His enemies there and then misinterpreted
that thesis as detraction of the Virgin Mary. And they got rid of Nestorius,
condemning him at the Council of Ephesus in 431.</p>
<p>It might have seemed a good moment to establish peace, but the Egyptian monks
came out for denial of the human element of Christ and, in A.D. 449,
representatives of all the churches of the Empire and also of other trends came
to an Oecumenical Council, again at Ephesus. The issue was whether there was a
human substance in Christ as well as the divine. The question was not an idle
one at that time. If the Egyptian Monophysites were right, then not a man but
God suffered on the cross, God who could easily suffer the ordeal and torment
and even not feel them. But if so, then he was not an example for us people
because we are weak and are susceptible to pain. But on the other hand, was
recognition of human nature in Christ not a belittling of him? Therefore the
Monophysites shouted: 'Cut in two those who recognize two natures!'. The Council
promised to be stormy.</p>
<p>The doctrine of the two natures was supported by the Greeks and the Italians
(the Patriarch and the Pope); the Egyptians opposed them. During the session a
crowd of a thousand Egyptian monks, unkempt and bearded, in hair-shirts, and
wielding big axes, broke into the premises where the Council was meeting. The
monks began to beat up the bishops, broke the fingers of the scribes, and
stamped on the Patriarch. And the guard sent by a suborned grandee did not
interfere, because the soldiers lacked elementary drive and consequently
initiative.</p>
<p>Now let me try to analyze the situation. The Syrian peasants were
dissatisfied with the Byzantine officials both before Nestorius' ascension to
the patriarchal throne and during his reign in Constantinople, and after his
exile. But their dissatisfaction had no connection with the Immaculate
Conception and Nativity. But the population of Syria supported the views of
Nestorius, apparently, because they were closer to them and understandable. But
when students of the Ephesus divinity school and certain Ephesian hierarchs
(opponents of the Monophysites) emigrated to Persian Mesopotamia, the popular
movement in Syria died out. Those dissatisfied with the oppression of the
Constantinople government remained, of course, but after the edict of the
Emperor Zeno (Henoticon, the Reconciler) in A.D. 482, which compromised with the
Monophysites, they united with the Egyptians, i.e. changed their ideological
position by 1800 so as to maintain their socio-political position.</p>
<p>The sincere supporters of Nestorius, who honoured him as a righteous man
tormented in exile, founded a Christian university in Nisibis, spread
Christianity as far as China, and were faithful subjects of the Shah of Iran,
i.e. political opponents of Constantinople. But they remained Byzantines in
their way of thought, mentality, and stereotype of behaviour. Byzantium thus
overflowed its state frontiers like a boiling liquid splashes out of the vessel
containing it.</p>
<p>After that there followed a duel between Constantinople and Alexandria, or
between the Egyptian Church and the Greek Patriarchate. Their strengths were
almost equal. The position of the secular authorities, who were afraid of the
growing influence of the Church, decided the problem.</p>
<p>In A.D. 451 a new council was held in Chalcedon, presided over by the Emperor
Marcian. The Council of Chalcedon abrogated the decision of the Robber Council
of Ephesus of 449. The Egyptians replied to this by a schism, did away with
Greek in the divine service, and elected a special Coptic Patriarch. A second
patriarchate was founded in Antioch by Jacobus Baradaeus; its followers were
subsequently called Jacobites.</p>
<p>The attempt of the Emperor Heracleonas to put an end to the split by adopting
a compromise decision only led to the rise of yet another current in the seventh
century, which took shape as the sect of Maronites, who established themselves
in the mountains of Lebanon. The Byzantine ethnos, united in the fourth century
A.D., thus split up into four mutually hostile subethnoi. That led to factual
separation of the Roman Patriarchate, and consequently of the whole West,
emigration of the Nestorians to the East, and passage of the Monophysites under
the authority of the Arab Caliphs. In the seventh century the Eastern Roman
Empire was converted into a Greek kingdom.</p>
<p>Who won in the confessional disputes? Only the enemies of Orthodoxy and
Byzantium. The Arian Langobards conquered the greater part of Italy; the Muslim
Arabs conquered Syria, Egypt, Carthage, Armenia, and Georgia; the pagan Slavs
ravaged the Balkan Peninsula and settled in it as far as the Peloponnese.
Byzantium needed unity, but that proved unachievable. The drive of the urban
population rose and compelled its bearers to manifest themselves by uniting in
competing consortia. And those in turn grew into stibethnoi, and after
separation from the Empire into ethnoi. Sometimes the heretical communities were
founded oil ancient tribes that had held out against Hellenistic levelling, but
more often they were consortia that arose in big towns, genetically
heterogeneous, and united only by behavioural dominants and complementariness.
In other words, this was an intensive process of ethnogenesis in which dogmas
played the role of symbols for those involved in the events, and of indicators
for historians.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Collapse of drive.</font></i></b> In the seventh century A.D. it appeared
that the attempt to resurrect the Roman Empire had failed. Justinian had
overestimated the forces of his people and underestimated the strength of the
eastern enemy. It is difficult to blame him for that. He supposed that the only
serious opponent of Byzantium was Persia. But that state had been weakened by
the reforms of the Vizier Mazdak (A.D. 488-529), and the liquidation of their
consequences, and also by the uprising of Bahram Cobin (590-591), which killed
the best part of the regular army. The war of 604-628, however, was won by
Byzantium with extreme efforts and thanks to the aid of Turkuts based in
Khazaria.</p>
<p>Both Byzantium and Iran overstrained themselves in that war, so that the
appearance of a new ethnos the Muslim Aral), composed of relict tribes of the
Arabian Peninsula, proved a tragedy for both the Persians and the Greeks. Iran
was completely conquered and plucked clean. Byzantium lost Syria, Egypt,
Carthage, and the Cilician plain, and only in A.D. 718 were the Arabs beaten at
the walls of Constantinople, after which the war being waged on the territory of
Asia Minor was converted into a series of plundering raids and counter-raids.</p>
<p>Byzantium also suffered losses in the Balkan Peninsula. Bulgarians, fleeing
from the Khazars, crossed the Danube in 679 and occupied the country between the
Danube and the Balkan Mountains. The Eastern Roman Empire had become a Greek
kingdom which did not care a fig for half-wild Western Europe, which had been
converted from a hub (if world power into an object of plundering raids by Arabs
from the south, Avars from the cast, and Scandinavian Vikings from the north.
The exhaustion of drive was even more disastrous than its rise.</p>
<p>But the forces of Byzantium were so great that after the loss of these lands
whose population wanted to separate the Constantinople government subdued the
Slavonic tribes in the Balkan Peninsula (A.D. 689), and beat off the Arabs from
the walls of the capital in 718. The warlike Isaurians took on the initiative in
the war with the Muslims, but they, too, were very different from the Greeks.
The ethno-cultural differences, weakly felt at a low level of drive, sharpened
in the eighth century when the Byzantine ethnos entered a violent phase of
collapse expressed in the iconoclasm of the Emperors of the Isaurian dynasty.</p>
<p>That was a time, perhaps, rather worse than the preceding phase of upsurge,
when the mounting drive of the whole region dismantled the golden ring of the
Empire's frontiers and threw Syria, Egypt, Africa, and Armenia into the arms of
the Ommiad Caliphs, and Italy under the heel of&quot; Langobard kings. The
division (hen arose naturally. The Arians, Monophysites, and Nestorians claimed
that they were not such ignoramuses as the Orthodox because they understood the
Holy Scriptures better. The Chalcedonites replied to them the same way, after
which ethnic divergence set in, with ethno-psychological motives of confessional
declarations. But the quarrelers could be separated, which was the natural
outcome, but with iconoclasm everything was unnatural, and therefore terrible.</p>
<p>The Orthodox emperor, victor over the impious Muslims and pagan Bulgars, in
fact suddenly banned religious art on the pretext of the need to separate
speculative philosophy and the emotional element of art, and even, using his
official position, wanted to leach the monks, specialists in their affairs. But
who supported him? The martinets and the grandee toadies of both secular and
spiritual rank. Not like heresy, but loathsome.</p>
<p>I have deliberately left aside a historical analysis of iconoclasm in its
political, economic, and ideological aspects. Much has been written about it,
but not what is important for the ethnologist. The most profound thoughts of the
emperors and patriarchs cannot explain why an Isaurian soldier cut down the
image of the Mother of God with a sword, and why Greek women, risking their
lives, stoned the soldier and beat him with sticks. Indeed, both the one and the
other were illiterate both in theology and in politics, and they were not
thinking of such complicated subjects at such a moment.</p>
<p>There is a simple and true explanation of the character of the events of that
epoch. Iconoclasm was a phenomenon of Asia Minor, icon-worship was Hellenic. For
the Asian icons were a decoration of the temple where one bad to exalt one's
spirit to the throne of Truth as an abstraction without a visible image. For the
Greek icons were a window on the other life; in them were depicted an image and
not a mask, and even not a face. Spiritual perfection therefore came through
aesthetic perception. Truth was discovered in that way.</p>
<p>In Byzantium, in the eighth century, drive was at its acme, so that even
unprincipled disagreements, developed into pretexts for bloodshed, which did not
do thing,, any good. Italy, where the Langobards took Ravenna in A.D. 751, and a
secular state of the Popes was founded in 756, fell away front Byzantium. And
the Emperor Constantine V Copronymus, instead of reestablishing order in the
lost region, avenged himself on the defenseless lovers of fine art at home.</p>
<p>The Seventh Council of Nicea in A.D. 787 gave temporary relief, bit during
the period of troubles the Bulgars succeeded in establishing themselves on the
Danube. Only in Asia were indisputable successes achieved, and those only
because matters were even worse in the Caliphate, which united the Arab-Muslim
superethnos. Under the Abbasid dynasty the Caliphate broke up, the ethnic
principle, clothed in confessional form, being decisive, as in Byzantium. in its
demoralization the Caliphate outdid Byzantium, which managed, in the next,
inertial phase of ethnogenesis, to grow stronger politically and economically,
thanks to which it outlived the Caliphate. Now let me draw a conclusion.</p>
<p>During the first three phases an ethnic system overcomes exter≠nal effects,
since it is elastic. I</p>
<p>There is always a basis, in an ethnos, usually preponderant numerically,
consisting of harmonious individuals whose drive and instinct are balanced.
These are serious people. When the people with sub-drive among them begin to
behave like scoundrels they resort to lynch law, or organize the deportation of
people they do not like to colonies. They thus preserve the vital ethnic
stereotype and I tradition, the basis of people's signal heredity.</p>
<p>It is more complicated with people with drive. They arc needed and can defend
themselves. They therefore enjoy broad opportunities to kill both others and one
another. But the very existence of people with drive in a system makes it
plastic and capable of resisting external influences, because they know how to
find a way out of the most complicated collisions. And when equilibrium is
established among the three types of members of an ethnos, the system is almost
invincible. But as soon as this equilibrium is disturbed with a change of phase
it is easy to strike from outside into the gap forming between the phases. Then
the ethnos may easily perish, through displacement.</p>
<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">Displacement</h4>
<b>
<i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>There is also a pattern in this.</font></i></b> I have not described the
actual aspect of global ethnogenesis but rather its ideal pattern, which is
constantly disrupted in fact by influences external to a given ethnos. I have
therefore had to take examples from world history, because no one lives alone,
but only among neighbours, and any ethnos is constantly disturbed by neighbours,
whether older and more experienced, or younger and more ardent. But an ideal
curve was necessary in order to interpret the character of infringements of the
process as such, because we usually, in fact, see zigzags that cancel each other
out over long stretches of ethnic history. Now we know that the inertia of an
impulse of drive is lost over 1200 years in any variant, even the most
favourable; and only fortunate ethnoi survive to their natural end. In history
we see constant breaks of ethno-geneses at different ages, but here too there is
a statistical pattern.</p>
<p>An ethnos that is in the first phases of ethnogenesis is practically
ineradicable and unconquerable, because an expenditure of effort is needed to
conquer it such that no success will recoup. But an ethnos that is changing
phase of development is very vulnerable and may become the victim of a neighbour
if the latter has enough drive. Let me therefore draw attention to the bends or
kinks of an ethnos' curve of drive, the more so that they are always smooth,
with diffuse edges. The curves also have their imperatives.</p>
<p>The transition from a stable state to an upsurge is marked by an imperative:
'It is necessary to reform the world because it is bad'. That is always more or
less motivated, but the risk is great. A newborn ethnos that has not yet
gathered strength may break against the strong resistance of neighbours that do
not want to be put right. That happened with the Zulus in the nineteenth century
when Chaka provided them with modernized assegais, trained the formations, and
led them to victories. But Chaka had not taken the tactical progress of Europe
into consideration. When muzzle-loaded smoothbore guns were replaced by Stutzen
guns, the Boers defeated the Zulus in 1838 and founded the republic of Transvaal
in the conquered land.</p>
<p>A little longer another Zulu kingdom, the Matabele, was holding out, which
had broken away from Chaka in 1820. The commander of the army sent to conquer
the south, Moselekatse, did not return but made himself king. In 1893 his son
Lobengula was beaten by the English troops of Cecil Rhodes. The Zulus' drive was
drowned in their own blood.</p>
<p>There are so many similar examples that it is more important to note the
second danger for an ethnos that arises during the transition from the phase of
upsurge to the acme. Then the subordination of the elements is disturbed; each
wants 'to be himself', and for the sake of that smashes the created
organization, sacrificing the interests of (he ethnos to his own. In I his case
as a rule blood flows freely, but the culture does not suffer, but rather
flourishes.</p>
<p>A clear example of this variant is the disintegration of the Arab Caliphate
into emirates in the tenth century. The coincidence of the political collapse
and the flowering of Muslim polyethnic culture, noted by all specialists was
obviously not accidental. Recognition of the value of the unique creative
personality put scholars writing in Arabic in a special position. Sultans and
emirs did not see rivals in them, but valued their works, granting them the
right 'to be themselves' in the intellectual and aesthetic sphere. But such
'displacement' sometimes yields tragic results, as I shall show below.</p>
<p>The third bend is much more dangerous for an ethnos, viz., the transition
from the acme to the inertial phase. The imperative 'We are tired of the great'
arises, on the basis of which not only the superfluous die, but also needed
people with drive, and sometimes even inoffensive cranks.</p>
<p>The Athenians, during the decline of drive, dealt with Socrates and
Alcibiades. The death of Socrates covered them with a shame for centuries, which
they could ignore, but the double exiling of Alcibiades ensured defeat in the
Peloponnesian War, with the troubles that stemmed from that. The deplorable
examples did not reform the Athenian demos. After it had 'shaken off' Plato and
Aris≠totle, and a number of other active fellow-citizens, who were de≠prived
of their property by a vote (the merchant who supplied Ath≠ens with Scythian
grain was ordered to pay for a theatrical perfor≠mance or to build a shrine),
Athens lost her independence. Alexan≠der the Great spared the beautiful city,
but the next conquerors, the Romans, behaved toward the Athenians according to
the cus≠toms of their time: some were killed, and the rest sold into slavery.</p>
<p>The antique Greco-Latin superethnos experienced the inertial phase in the
first and second centuries B.C. At that time Hellenic people of drive could only
serve the Republic, either as soldiers or as teachers of literature, without
hope of improving their position in life. But even for the Romans it was not
easy in the flexure of the first century A.D. Ovid died in exile, and I Horace
and Virgil were court toadies and bootlickers. Seneca perished from tile envy of
Nero; and the number of ordinary, but talented people who drew attention to
themselves and therefore perished is incalculable. The character and direction
of these reprisals against defenseless, innocent fellow-countrymen were vividly
described by Suetonius in his <i>De vita Caesarum</i> (Lives of the Twelve
Caesars) and by Gaston Boissier in his <i>L'Opposition sous lea Cesars</i> (The
Opposition of the Times of the Roman Caesars).</p>
<p>The system of murders of the best, not by nobility and wealth but by personal
qualities, was a sign of the times, and normal facing of the process of
ethnogenesis. Precisely the same symptoms, obviously of the same sickness, are
to be seen in Byzantium under the Ducas dynasty (eleventh century) and in Iran
of the end of the Mongol period (fourteenth century), and in Central Asia after
the Timurids (sixteenth century). So this is a disease of aging. Having said
that, let us return to Rome.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The depletion and decline of drive</font></i><font COLOR="#ff0000">.</font></b>
When the East of the former empire was seething, the West was steadily cooling.
At the beginning of the fifth century A.D. the frontier on the Rhine and Danube
was broken. In 402 the Visigoths burst into Italy but were defeated at Verona.
In 405 a horde of Suevi, Burgundians, Vandals, and Alans invaded Italy, but were
defeated at Florence in 406 and withdrew. That showed the way into Gaul, where
the Franks and Alemanni had already conquered the banks of the Rhine. They broke
the Vandals, but saved themselves and not Gaul, which was laid waste. The Gauls
did not defend themselves, but only prayed. Who could imagine that these were
the descendants of the heroic Celts. The same happened in Spain, where the Suevi
decided to settle in Galicia, the Alans in Lusitania, and the Vandals in
Beetles, which has been called Andalusia since then. In 410 the Goths took Rome,
pillaged it, sparing only the churches, and in 412 occupied southern Gaul, in
419 drove the Vandals from Spain into Africa, and received Aquitaine as a gift
for that. The Burgundians settled on the left bank of the Rhone, and the
Alemanni on the left bank of the Rhine. In 430-439 the Vandals, driven from
Spain by the Visigoths, occupied Africa, where they were supported by the Moors
and Numidians, and in 455 seized Rome and subjected it to senseless destruction.
In 449 Angles, Saxons, and Jutes appeared in Britannia, from which the Romans
had withdrawn the legions. The British Celts proved no better than the Gallic
ones, and let themselves be broken.</p>
<p>In 476 the Heruli, who were in the Roman service, took power into their own
hands and suppressed the Western Empire. Ten years later the last islet of
civilization, Soissons, was wiped out, conquered by the savage Franks. The
Burgundians settled in the valley of the Rhone.</p>
<p>In 489 the Ostrogoths left the banks of the Danube and Lake Balaton, moved
into Italy, and in 193 broke the</p>
<p>Germans who defended it. All these Germans were subject to the effect of an
impulse of drive of the second century and were consequently in the upgrade
phase.</p>
<p>But what is remarkable is that in the Western and Eastern Empires there was
the same social structure, same religion, and same enemy, the barbarians, who
were pressing with equal force. But the East repelled the attacks, while the
West fell, because it was in the phase of obscuration That is what renewal of
the ethnos due to the arising drive of the population yielded, and that is why
newcomers from the East (the Vandal Stilicho and the half-German Aetius)
defended Rome. People of that mentality were not known in the West, but in the
East they were famous, from Belisarius to Alexius Murzuphlus and John
Cantacuzene.</p>
<p>That short reminder was necessary in order to explain how terrible the loss
of drive is; without it it is impossible even to defend oneself successfully.
For the barbarians were very few; the Vandals, for example, were only 80 000, 16
000 of them warriors. But they reduced Rome to ashes. The lands conquered by the
Germans were long considered a heavy loss.</p>
<p>In the sixth century Justinian adopted a policy of resurrecting the Roman
Empire. He succeeded in, wiping out the Vandal and Ostrogoth kingdoms and wore
down the Visigoths in Spain, but there was not enough money, people, or ideas
for the conquest of Constantinople ñ what with the struggle with the Goths,
when the Slavs and Persians were pressing at home, and in place of the Goths had
arrived the Langobards, behind whom there were the even more ferocious Franks.
Preaching worked better on the Franks than weapons, but for intellectual
pressure a clear awareness of aim, and internal unity, ensuring mutual aid of
the missionaries, were extremely necessary. But there never was that in
Byzantium, even having got rid of the Gnostics and Neoplatonists.</p>
<p>The Langobards' invasion of Italy, won back by Byzantine generals from the
Ostrogoths, occurred in A.D. 568. But the Langobards seized only part of Italy.
So a frontier was established between Byzantium and the lost lands where
Germanic kingdoms were located, and where Roman citizens were converted into
defeated peoples and oppressed classes.</p>
<p>The great migration of peoples is thus explainable as a consequence of the
drive which ruined the Dacians and Jews, having compelled them to hurl
themselves on Rome too soon, when it still had its own forces, and which ensured
victory of the Christian communities that created Byzantium. In the East the
potentials of the impulses of force were equal, and conquests therefore were not
made. But in the West, where the difference in the potentials was considerable,
Goths, Vandals, Burgundians, Suevi, Alans, Langobards, and Franks flowed,
spontaneously as it were, into the civilized regions. They were not numerous but
had drive, i.e. each one of them thought not only about his own skin, but also
about his tribe, family, leader, fame, and future. But having conquered the
beautiful coasts of the Mediterranean, the inhabitants of the Baltic forests and
the Black Sea steppes proved unadapted to the new conditions. They themselves
did not know how to farm but, being the victors, they took all the very best.
But even that was not feasible without involvement of the aborigines. The
barbarian kingdoms of the fifth and sixth centuries were therefore converted
into chimeric entities, rapacious but unstable. In the seventh century the Arabs
subjected Africa and Spain to themselves, meeting resistance only from the
hillmen of the Atlas and Asturias, i.e. where the ancient landscape had been
least influenced by Roman civilization. Ancient ethnoi, Berbers and Basques, had
survived there, living in tune with nature. The nature of their land had thus
protected them.</p>
<p>The descendants of the Roman colonists, who had cut down the forests to build
luxurious villas and temples, and who carried on commercial sheep-farming on the
devastated expanses of Spain, and who trampled the thin humus layer by
government herds in the southern foothills of the Atlas Mountains, unrestored to
this day, proved defenseless, however, in face of fierce conquerors ñ
northerners (Scandinavians), easterners (Avars), and southerners (Arabo-Berber
Muslims).</p>
<p>These unfortunate peoples no longer expected help from the East. The Greeks
and the Wallachians (people who spoke Latin, also known as Vlachs) had ceased to
look upon each other as fellow-countrymen. Historical fate or 'force of
circumstances' had taken them along different roads.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Reciprocity.</font></i></b> For a long time the victors (Teutons) and the
conquered (Wallachians) coexisted without merging, hating and despising each
other. Western Europe was transformed from a superethnos into a zone of ethnic
contacts with all the negative consequences of that. All the barbarian kingdoms
that arose on the conquered lands broke up with staggering rapidity, carrying
away with them the culture of Rome and the courage of the old Germans, which was
converted by the seventh century into ferocity and cruelty. <a name="ebe6text33"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note33">[+33]</a>
With ethnic cross-breeding the processes of destruction were equally accelerated
for both conquerors and conquered.</p>
<p>In that same eighth century, when Byzantium was experiencing the violent
internal change expressed in iconoclasm, and in Asia superethnoi were
flourishing and expanding that had arisen in the seventh century ñ the
Arab-Muslim, Tabghatch (mediaeval China), Turkic-Tibetan (they can be united by
attributes of genesis and territory), Western Europe was experiencing a profound
decline. It had become the object of expansion. The Arabs had reached the Loire,
the Avars were raiding to the Rhine, Slavs had occupied the right bank of the
Elbe, and even forced its lower reaches. The economic system inherited from Rome
had completely broken down, and as a consequence virgin forest was restored in
France, <a name="ebe6text34"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note34">[+34]</a>
which indicates an exceptional lowering of drive, since the most conservative
class, the peasantry, lowered the intensity of landworking to the minimum that
enabled them simply not to die of hunger. The kings of the Merovingian dynasty,
even then, were given the nickname of 'lazy, but their nobles vied with each
other in wild licentiousness and unruliness, and neglect of traditions of
fidelity and duty. The damage from the mixing of two superethnoi was reciprocal.</p>
<p>The policy of the first Carolingians (Pepin the Tall, Charles Martel, and
Pepin the Short) who held the attack of the Arabs and entered into an alliance
with the Pope of Rome, was a certain attempt to introduce order. The result of
their efforts was the empire of Charlemagne, which broke up already under his
grandsons. Everything in that empire was imported. The ideology was taken from
Byzantium, education from Ireland, military technique (knightly cavalry) was
borrowed from the Avars, medicine from the Spanish Arabs and Jews. Taken all
together this is called the 'Carolingian renaissance'.</p>
<p>The empire of the Carolingians is treated as a French dynasty in traditional
historiography, the counting of the kings beginning with Charlemagne. Thierry
proposed a better founded conception, pointing out that the Carolingians
exercised their dominion on the territory of modern France by brute force.
Britanny, Aquitaine, Provence, and Burgundy only recognized their authority
because they could not defend their own independence. The Eastern Franks, on the
contrary, the ancestors of the Franconians, were inseparably united with the
Carolingians. This dynasty, and the ethnos of the Franks supporting it, should
thus be classed in the Germanic superethnos of the great migration of peoples.
Which it was; and from that angle the Franks' military successes are readily
explicable.</p>
<p>On the general background of the diminishing drive of the Germanic settlers
mixing with the descendants of the Gallo-Romans, the handful of nobles gathered
around Charles Martel, Pepin the Short, and Charlemagne were strong because
their opponents were weaker. The Carolingians crushed the independence of
Provence (A.D. 737-739), Aquitaine (760-768), Lombardy (774), Bavaria (788), and
the Saxon tribes (797), took Barcelona from the Arabs (801), and defeated the
Avars (802-803). But with the exception of the last two, these were victories
over their own ñ 'Germans beat Germans'. And under the heirs of Charlemagne
even these successes were reduced to nought. The valleys of the Danube and Elbe
were conquered by Slavs, the 'Spanish Mark' separated off from the Empire and
the latter broke up into its constituent parts.</p>
<p>It is thus justified to treat Charlemagne's Empire not as the beginning of a
European mediaeval superethnos, but as the end of the inertia of the great
migration of peoples.</p>
<p>Growth of a system as a rule creates an inertia of development, which is
slowly lost through the resistance of the environment, as a consequence of which
the descending branch of the curve of ethnogenesis is longer than the ascending
one. Even when the vitality of an ethnos falls below the optimum, the social
institutions continue to exist, sometimes outliving the ethnos that created
them. Thus Roman law survived in Western Europe although ancient Rome and proud
Byzantium became memories.</p>
<p>The socio-economic periodization ñ the beginning of the formation of
feudalism ñ by no means coincides with the ethnological periodization. Early
feudal states rose on the territory of Gaul in the fifth and sixth centuries
A.D. under conquerors (Merovingians, Burgundians, and Bretons), who divided up
this rich country. That means that the beginning of French ethnogenesis is
separated from the beginning of the feudal formation by four centuries, and
consequently that these processes are not linked together functionally.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the feudalism rising on this land was typologically different.
Five types of feudalism correspond to the rive ethnic regions that arose there
because of the invasions of the barbarians. The Franks established a harmonic
mixture of barbarian and antique elements in the valleys of the Seine and Marne;
the Burgundians, former allies of Rome, confiscated one-third of the serfs, half
of the villas, and two-thirds of the arable land from the local inhabitants, and
being Arians did not mix with the aborigines for a long time; Provence, where
Visigoths, Ostrogoths, and Arabs succeeded one another, preserved so many
traditions of the antique cities that it resembles Byzantium and not the Western
world; Aquitaine, again, where the Visigoths dominated for less than a hundred
years (A.D. 418 to 507) differed markedly from neighbouring Provence and from
the land of the Franks. Britanny, i.e. ancient Armorica, has a special place. It
was conquered from the Romans in the middle of the fifth century by Bretons, and
defended by them against the Frank expansion right up to 845, after which an
independent Breton kingdom was founded, and a separate archbishopric of Dol.</p>
<p>So the contours of the processes of ethnogenesis peep through the tissue of
social development.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Anomalies.</font></i></b> Here I come to an exciting problem, viz., the
relation between culture as an ideological and technical entity and ethnos as a
phenomenon of the biosphere. The early Christian culture, a quite definite
concept in the period under consideration, i.e. the fourth to eighth centuries
A.D., embraced not only the whole territory of the former Roman Empire, but also
neighbouring lands (Armenia, parts of Arabia, Abyssinia, Germany) and the
emerald isle Erin. The fate of the last-named is particularly noteworthy. The
Celts received the Christian tradition in A.D. 432-461 from Syria and Egypt, and
not from Rome (about which I have already spoken above). The poor mendicant
monks created a new Thebaid on the Emerald Isle, with the sole difference that
they sheltered in reed huts instead of caves. With them a vapid, splendid church
hierarchy did not arise, but the monks' influence on the people was immense.
Nothing linked them with Rome. Even the celebration of Easter did not follow the
Julian calendar but coincided with a definite date of spring. Until the end of
the eleventh century Irish monks were the most cultured Christians in Western
Europe and defended their independence from the Roman Popes just as steadfastly
as their flocks from the Saxon and Norman kings of England.</p>
<p>Consequently, when examining the collision through the aspect of the history
of culture, we should count the Celts as an Early Christian, i.e. Byzantine,
entity, as one of its variants. The 'Carolingian renaissance' and Visigoth
Spain, too, should be classed as such. That would be a logical and consistent
solution of the problem. But every historian sees that it is not sufficient and
is therefore unsatisfactory. And how could it be otherwise if we did not take
into account that the bearers of this culture (as of any other) were people, and
there is no person on Earth without an ethnos and no ethnos without a homeland,
by which must be understood an original and unique combination of terrain and
geobiocoenosis.</p>
<p>I have already remarked that the drive impulse embraced only the belt of
Eastern Europe and the Near East from Sweden to Palestine. The Celts were
consequently outside it; seemingly therefore the Britti, abandoned by the Romans
in 406-407, lost the wars with the Picts and the Anglo-Saxons, who slaughtered
all the male Celts. Only the western regions of Britannia held out for a long
time against the fierce enemy. The Celts often passed to the counterattack, won
minor victories and even migrated to the Continent, turning Romanized Armorica
into Celtic Brittany independent of the Frankish kings and hostile to them.</p>
<p>Another Celtic tribe, the Scotti, had already in Roman times crossed from
Ireland to the north of Britannia and spread terror among the Britons subject to
Rome by frequent raids. They continued this struggle with the Anglo-Saxons and
Normans down to the tenth century. In short the Celts seem to have acquired
sudden force. But was it simply that? Let us look.</p>
<p>Wales, Cornwall, and especially Ireland were minimally sunk in Roman culture.
They had preserved their own tribal traditions, and the relatively small reserve
of drive left them from the epoch of the conquests. That reserve was too small
for Gaul and Britannia to be able to successfully resist Roman and Germanic
expansion, but when these lost their own drive, the Celts evened the balance of
forces, the culture they had borrowed from Byzantium neither strengthening nor
weakening their impulse. But it helped them define the ethno-psychological
dominant, active, though negative: 'We are not Germans, and we don't want to be
like them'. Such a counterposing proved sufficient for Wales (Cymru) to resist
the English until 1283, and for Ireland much longer, in spite of complete loss
of traditions of Byzantine culture.</p>
<p>The explanation I propose is tentative. It is possible that, at the beginning
of our era, there was a special impulse of drive on the coasts of the Atlantic
Ocean that passed south from Erin, across Vasconia, the Atlas, and the Sahara,
to the Gulf of Guinea. In that case the outbursts of activity of the Tuaregs
(Almoravids), Berbers (Almohads), and the beginning of the spread of the Bantu
are explicable. But this proposition needs detailed checking and is suggested
here as a working hypothesis.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The waning of youth. </font></b>The fact that (lie young peoples of Europe
conquered dilapidated Rome which infected them with its defects and brought them
low, is not surprising. But when an ethnos that has reached the acme phase
perishes from the hands of a weak opponent, it is strange. Any transition from
phase to phase obviously entails a danger for the ethnos. Just as a snake is
defenseless when shedding its skin, so an ethnos is powerless when it is
changing its spirit, i.e. the stereotype of behaviour and social imperative.</p>
<p>There is a very common opinion that the Spanish conquistadors discovered an
ancient civilization in Central and South Americas and made short work of it.
And all who love Indians, and they include the author of these lines, bewail the
Aztecs and the Incas, as the best representatives of their race and bearers of
an age-old culture.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it has been possible in recent times to establish certain
landmarks of American ethnogenesis. It has turned out that the ancient cultures
of the Indians of Mexico and Peru became extinct not very long ago, but
radically. The Olmecs, who lived on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico, disappeared
in the sixth century A.D., giving way to the arriving Totonacs. The Toltecs,
creators of the culture of Anahuac, founded their state around A.D. 720, but
what was before it? In Peru the ancient archaeological cultures of the Mochica
and Tiahuanaco ñ the pre-Inca culture of the Aymara ethnos ñ disappeared in
the eighth to tenth centuries A.D. The ethnic formations disappeared along with
the archaeological, because wars were waged to the extermination of the enemy in
America. The Incas were an exception, but they did not yet exist. The ancient
American ethnoi related to the Incas and the Aztecs as the Romans related to the
French and Spaniards, who inherited part of the traditions of linguistic culture
from the Romans, part of the gene fund, the ruins of cities, and scraps of
knowledge. But they were not Romans. Like them the Incas and Aztecs became new
ethnoi after their migration.</p>
<p>But in the ninth and tenth centuries A.D. the French, Provencals, Spaniards
(in Asturias), Germans, Lombards, and Piedmontese had already formed into ethnoi
of a new type; but in America I he 'great migration of peoples' started later.</p>
<p>Only in the twelfth century, if we believe the legends, did the mythical
first Incas (Manco Capac and Mama Ocly) appear, and then, too, around 1168 the
ancestors of the Aztecs crossed the Rio Grande and moved south with a number of
other tribes. In the twelfth century the Chichimecs (literally 'savages')
conquered the remnants of the Toltecs, whose cultural tradition was broken, like
the Roman in Gaul and Spain. Only in the fourteenth century did the Aztecs found
Tenochtitlan (1325) and take up the remnants of the Toltecs' culture. In the
same fourteenth century the Inca Viracocha founded the empire that the Spaniards
conquered, but the historicity of Viracocha is doubtful. Only in 1437 did
Pachacuti Inca defeat the Chanka, worthy enemies of the Incas, execute their
ruler, and force the remnants of this ethnos to flee to certain death in the
Amazon. <a name="ebe6text35"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note35">[+35]</a>
Later he seized the throne, executed the scholars who knew the history of the
Incas, banned I he study of writing, and introduced policing of moral%, by which
lie established tile civilization of the Incas. But by their place in
ethnogenesis or by the age of' the ethnos Viracocha was equivalent to
Charlemagne and Pachacuti to St. Louis and Lothar who gave semi-savage Europe
the possibility of the 'Carolingian renaissance', education, and creative
thought.</p>
<p>Pachacuti's successor Topa Inca conquered the Chimu state (modern Ecuador) in
1476 and established a regime of brutal exploitation of the local Indians,
forcing them to cultivate the state fields, and in winter to build roads in the
Andes. There seems to be no doubt that anyone who sympathizes with the Indians
should hate the Incas; it is only logical.</p>
<p>In the same fifteenth century when the epoch of the 'Renaissance' set in in
Italy, the Aztec king Itzcoatl (1428-1440) and his counsellor the thinker
Tlacateod revived the culture of the Toltecs. ItzcoatI and his successor
Montezuma I (1440-1468) conquered Anahuac (Southern Mexico) and Tlacateotl
introduced the 'cult of flowers', i.e. human sacrifices in order to save Earth
from a future catastrophe. That was murder for the sake of murder, evil in pure
form.</p>
<p>The local population defended itself as best it could. The Huaxfees and
Tarascas defeated the Aztecs who were trying to capture youths from them for
sacrifices. The Araucans repulsed the army of the Incas that was trying to
impose the Inca civilization on them. Atahualpa, the semi-legitimate son of Topa
Inca (by an Indian concubine) was used by the chiefs of tribes living around
Quito (Ecuador) against the legitimate heir Huascar Inca. In 1527 the rebels won
and killed all the Incas they took prisoner. The women and children were
tortured especially cruelly. Few of the Incas survived. It was at that tragic
moment that the Spaniards arrived. In 1532 Pizarro took Atahualpa prisoner,
robbed the temples of their wealth, falsely claimed ransom, and executed the
prisoner. And no one moved a finger.</p>
<p>But who would have stood up for him? For the Incas he was a tyrant and
traitor, for the Indians a scion of the Inca oppressors. When the last great
Inca, Manco Capac, called the Indians to a liberating war, only a few followed
him, to defeat whom a few hundred Spaniards of Almagro's company were sufficient
(1535).</p>
<p>The empire of the Muisca (or Chibcha) in modern Colombia was overthrown with
the same case. That was the 'El Dorado' itself that the greedy, imaginative
conquistadores were looking for. Success fell to the lot of Gonzalo Quesada in
1536, to whom the Muisea put tip a very weak resistance. They, it turns out,
were also a relatively new ethnos, since the ancient cultures of' the northern
Andes had disappeared only at the beginning of (lie second millennium A.D.
Tribes invading from the north had exterminated the aborigines. The victor
Spaniards found such humiliation of the lower orders by the high-ups as they
themselves imitate even a half of it. An Indian, for example, who was considered
of high rank among the Muisca, was thrown into an underground lake where
poisonous snakes swam in utter darkness. The unfortunate man swam there until he
bumped into a snake and died from its bite. And appellants were only allowed to
talk to the authorities when sitting with their backs turned and their faces
buried in their bended knees. It will readily be realized why the Indians did
not take to defending their rulers.</p>
<p>And the southern Araucans (Manuche) exhibited such courage that the
Conquistador Pedro de Valdivia fell in 1553 and his whole company perished. In
1598 the Araucans drove the Spaniards back across the Bio-bio, and in 1744 Spain
recognized Araucania as an independent country and received its ambassador in
Santiago de Chile. But the Araucans were not a 'civilized' people. They
preserved their ancient traditions. That means that the impulse of drive of the
thirteenth century, and the great migration of the peoples of America of the
thirteenth century, did not affect them. Because in the early phases of
ethnogenesis an ethnos is as weak as in the end ones.</p>
<p>In the same way Cortez, who had 1 000 Spaniards, defeated 30 000 brave
Aztecs, because the Totonacs and Chichimecs from Tlaxcala mustered 50 000
warriors to crush the hegemony of the Aztecs. These Indians deliberately
preferred the Spaniards, whom they saw as a tribe equal to themselves, to the
Aztecs. Perhaps they miscalculated; for the Inquisition, which the Spaniards
took to America, was an institution about which no good can be said. But one
might not come before its court, because, in its idea, the Inquisition was
created for defence and not for attack.</p>
<p>I shall explain. In 1529 the Turks captured Algeria. The coastline of Spain
was open to landings by Muslims, and within the country there were many Moriscos
and Jews who dreamed precisely of such a development of events. The Spanish
government, justifiably doubting the loyalty of the heterodox, prohibited them
from holding military and civil posts, but it could not forbid their being
baptized. Since a baptized Moor or a Jew received the right to make a career on
equal terms with a Spaniard, many accepted baptism hypocritically, and continued
to observe the rites of their old faith. It was these that the Inquisition
exposed and punished for apostasy. Which meant that in order not to have trouble
with a tribunal, one could simply not adopt Catholicism.</p>
<p>In America the Inquisition strictly punished for making human sacrifices,
especially for the killing of children. That, of course, violated the conscience
of the Indians, but who then would protect their children? Am Indian who
refrained from making sacrifices need not worry for his own life. But it was far
more difficult to keep himself safe from the Aztecs. They dragged any prisoner
who turned up to the altar, irrespective of what he did at home. And if fie was
wise, brave, and handsome, the greater was his chance of coming under the
obsidian knife. That is why the Spaniards took firm root in America for 300
years.</p>
<p>When we examine the history of Europe and America in the proposed diachronic
aspect, we see that in America there was its own kind of 'great migration' and
'death of antique culture', but the impulse of drive that caused a new explosion
of ethnogenesis occurred 500 years later, in the thirteenth century. The Aztecs
and Incas, in creating their empires, were the same foreign conquerors for the
local population as the Anglo-Saxons were for the Celts, and the Franks for the
Gallo-Romans. Consequently, at the beginning of the sixteenth century the Aztecs
and Incas were at the age at which the French, Spaniards and Italians were in
the tenth century. But that was the epoch of the disintegration of the European
culture inherited from Rome, and of a lowering of resistance to external blows!
The Hungarians, Berbers, and Scandinavians pillaged the Carolingian Empire and
the Anglo-Saxon kingdoms as effectively as the Spaniards and Portuguese robbed
their future colonies in the sixteenth century. In short, the Aztecs and Incas
were invaded at a turning point in their growth, during the transition from the
phase of becoming to the acme of development, which did not set in because of
interference from outside.</p>
<p>But as soon as the Spaniards ran into tribes that were in stable phases, they
were beaten and passed to the defensive. Furthermore, the Comanches in the
eighteenth century began to drive the Spaniards back over the Rio Grande, and
the Seminoles conquered Florida, already settled by the Spaniards. In Mexico and
the country of the Andes, inter-breeding of Spaniards and Indians was so
intensive, with a great drive in both components, that new ethnoi arose, which
won independence in 1810-1822. In place of 'New Spain' there arose an
'Anti-Spain', which carried out the conquest of the Indian ethnoi of Yucatan,
Chile, Patagonia, and Tierra del Fuego, which had been beyond the power of the
conquistadors. The interrupted process was renewed, but only where it had been
before the sixteenth century. In North America a zone of contact of ethnoi
coming from Europe and Africa was created in place of the Indian superethnoi.</p>
<p>North America was populated by relatively old ethnoi that had returned to a
state of homeostasis. Exceptions were the Iroquois, who had penetrated the
region of the Great Lakes from the west not long before the coming of Europeans,
and the Athabascans in the foothills of the Cordilleras. Only they were the
fruit of an outburst of ethnogenesis and participants in the 'great migration of
peoples' in America. Around the twelfth century some of the Athabascans drove
the Eskimos into the tundra, while another part spread to the south, into
Arizona. But they did not succeed in creating a powerful state in the south
because the expanses of the prairies were inaccessible to hunters on foot. The
Athabascans, like their eastern neighbours the Comanches, huddled along the
banks of river valleys where there was little food, as a consequence of which
the population stopped growing. But as soon as the Spaniards' horses, escaping
to the prairies and becoming wild, became herds of mustangs, the prairie Indians
mastered horsemanship. The names of the Navajos and Apaches became famous
throughout the world.</p>
<p>But that was late. Squatters, trappers, and cowboys, descendants of the
colonists who had succeeded in adapting themselves to the New World, surpassed
the Indians in number and technique. That is another example of interrupted
ethnogenesis. But, in contrast to the southern variant, the process was not
renewed here. Mixed marriages did not shock the Spaniards, but the Anglo-Saxons,
especially the women, boycotted the 'squaw men' and ostracized them, while their
husbands were guided by the rule that 'a good Indian is a dead Indian'. The
tragedy of the northern Indians ended in the wars of the 1870s, which became
known as the 'Indian wars'. After that the Indian ethnoi in the U.S.A. remained
relicts.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Recovered youth</font></i><font COLOR="#ff0000">. </font></b>Spain possessed
colonies in South America and Mexico unhindered while she seemed invincible to
the colonists. But when Napoleon arrested the Spanish royal family in Bayonne in
1808, and put his brother Joseph on the throne in Madrid, and began a war
against the Spaniards who defended the traditions an independence of the
fatherland, the colonies stood aside. From 1810 to 1821-1822 Spain tried to
pacify the insurgents, but without success. Only some Indian tribes supported
the colonial regime, and that only because they hated the insurgent Creoles more
than the remote Spaniards. Let me draw attention to Mexico, because the revival
of the process altered by the conquest proceeded most visibly there.</p>
<p>In the sixteenth century the Spaniards and Indians rapidly mixed, and it
seemed that a local variant of the Spanish ethnos was arising in Mexico, but the
opposite happened. By the end of the eighteenth century four ethnic groups had
been formed instead of two, hating each other. It is suggested that this
division was the result of unsuccessful administration, but the causes seemingly
lay deeper; contact occurred at superethnic level, with a!! the consequences
stemming from that.</p>
<p>The top social stratum, which concentrated all important posts and trade in
its hands, consisted of' natives of Spain, who were called 'Gachupins' (men with
spurs). Their numbers were fairly small, and the attitude to them was negative.
But the Gachupins had control of the army and the clergy, which guaranteed their
privileges quite effectively.</p>
<p>One social step lower there were the Creoles (around a million persons),
natives of Mexico, descendants of the conquistadores, often with an admixture of
Indian blood. They were wealthy owners of haciendas on which Indians worked. The
Creoles lived in luxurious idleness, remaining loyal to the king and Church and
hating the Gachupin bureaucrats.</p>
<p>But at the beginning of the nineteenth century individuals with drive
appeared among the Creoles who were seeking to apply their energies. These
people began to read French literature and adopted an aim in life that led many
of them to a cruel death.</p>
<p>Three or four million Indians either worked on the haciendas as peons or in
the mines, or lived in their villages under the rule of caciques (chiefs). In
the sixteenth century their position had improved because the demands of the
Spanish officials did not exceed those of the Aztecs, and there was no need to
sacrifice children to Huitzilopochtli (the god of war). But in the seventeenth
and eighteenth centuries the Creole landowners began to encroach on the lands of
the Indian tribes, and the corrupt Gachupin officials defended them poorly. The
monks converted many Indians to Catholicism, but so weakly that the Indians
retained their own customs and their idols. But Indian children often showed
greater capacity in school than the Spaniards, and so it happened that
descendants of the Aztecs became teachers, who taught the descendants of the
conquistadores Latin and Catholic theology.</p>
<p>But the two million metises who had originated from mixed marriages in the
sixteenth century lived worst of all. The Creoles pushed them out of their
circle, and the Gachupins forbade them to live among the Indians so that they
would not incite the latter to rebellion. Only hard labour or robbery were
accessible to the metises, but a special police was organized against them, that
killed them without trial. Yet the number of metises, like their drive, rose,
because they had a mixture of the genes of the conquistadores and the Aztecs.
They therefore did not die out, but became established as a special subethnic
group with possibilities of development.</p>
<p>Thus, at the beginning of the nineteenth century Mexico returned to the phase
of upsurge that had been cut short earlier by Cortez.</p>
<p>In 1808 all these ethnic groups began to fight both against the Gachupins and
among themselves, because they hated each other. They were of one mind in one
thing only ≠they called themselves Americanos; in other respects, however,
there was no agreement among them. The first uprisings of the Indians, in
1810-1817, led by the priests Hidalgo and Morelos, were therefore defeated by
the regular army, in which the officers were Creoles and the soldiers metises
and mulattos. But already in 1921, Colonel Iturbide, a Creole with a touch of
the Indian, went over to the side of the advocates of independence, and withdrew
Spanish troops from Mexico. The Gachupins left the stage, but their place was
taken by Mexican conservatives, of which Iturbide was one.</p>
<p>The subsequent distribution of forces was as follows. The conservatives
banked on the clergy and army; these were mainly Creoles and descendants of
Spaniards. The moderate liberals ñ Creoles ñ wanted a liberal parliamentary
republic and retention of their estates; the extreme liberals ñ metises ñ
were enemies of the Church and the Army; the Indians wanted the whites to go
away and leave them in peace. Civil wars and revolutions continued until 1920,
and ended in victory of the metises, who adopted the social institutions of the
Indians ñ caciquism. The Indians could not win as an ethnos because they did
not represent an integral entity. As a matter of fact, each tribe was a separate
ethnos. Therefore the Indians with drive, like Benito Juares, for example, by
birth and upbringing a Sapotek, having received an education came close to the
metises ñ the extreme liberals ñ and defeated the French regular soldiers.</p>
<p>American diplomats made fun of Mexico, saying it could not sort its affairs
out. But in the acme phase their English forefathers had also fought the Wars of
the Roses. Mexico was simply passing I through this phase with a lag of three
centuries.</p>
<p>An overheating of drive usually makes many valuable memorials of art and
elements of culture non-existent. Mexico was no exception. Magnificent temples
with beautiful sculptures perished during the pronunciamento, which took place
with a cruelty surpassing the European Middle Ages. The metises were enemies of
everything European, including Catholicism. The Indians were pious; they needed
the churches but not the clergy. They went to the churches for their festivals,
decorating the statues of saints with garlands of flowers, like the old idols,
and danced before them as before the gods. The Creoles took up the defence of
the clergy, forming squads of 'Cristeros'. The rebellion was brutally
suppressed, the innocent peasants suffering most.</p>
<p>Thus elements of material culture - the use of iron and changes in the flora
and fauna (horses, cows, sheep, pigs, grapes, olives), remained as traces of the
conquest of Mexico by Spain. But the direction of ethnogenesis returned to its
own bed. It is more correct to see the three centuries of Spanish rule as a
zigzag on the curve of ethnogenesis. I shall not be able to judge what happened
later since the acme phase of the ethnogenesis of Latin America has still not
ended, and one can only make a forecast when the general pattern of events
becomes clear.</p>
<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">The Beginning of the Decline of Drive</h4>
<b>
<i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Calamity from excess. </font></i></b>We have already seen from the example of
Byzantium that a rise in the drive of an ethnic system is far from always in its
favour. For the Arab superethnos it proved tragic because the regions included
in the Caliphate that had received a charge of drive from the Arab conquerors
began to slip away from Baghdad. Sometimes these revolts were suppressed with a
vast expenditure of military forces, like the defeat of Mukanna, for example, in
Central Asia in A.D. 762, but more often they were successful. In 789 Morocco
broke away, in 820 Khorasan, in 867 Seistan. Two years later there was the
ghastly uprising of the Zindji (Zanzibar) slaves, which was led by an Arab. In
872 ibn Tulun proclaimed himself the independent ruler of Egypt; in 877 the
Karmathians took the offensive in Bahrein, and in 903-909 the Fatimids in Tunis.
Drive broke the shackles of the political system and in half-a-century converted
a well-ordered, law-obeying state, with a thriving economy and developing
culture, into a kaleidoscope of warring ethnoi, or of consortia striving to form
themselves into ethnoi.</p>
<p>Blood flowed so profusely that the Arabs lost hegemony in their own country.
In Africa the initiative passed to the Berbers and Tuaregs, in Iran to the
Dailamites, a hill tribe that until then had kept aside from politics; in
Central Asia the Tajiks gave way after a long struggle to Turks and Turkomans.
The immense forces of the Muslim superethnos were burned out within its own
system. The process of ethnogenesis initiated by the Arabs wiped out the ethnos
that generated it, but left behind an inviolable unique culture and a tradition
associated with it to which neighbouring ethnoi were attracted for a long time.</p>
<p>The process went rather differently in the Romano-German world. There it was
less intensive, which was all to the good of the Europeans, although the
features of the acme phase in Western Europe were expressed with maximum
clarity.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Train of golden ages</font></i><font COLOR="#ff0000">. </font></b>When we
examine the subsequent history of the West-European or Romano-German
superethnos, it is readily noted that different ethnoi took the lead in it by
turns, giving way to one another. This leadership was differently expressed, but
when it is examined as a function of the drive of ethnoi comprising the
superethnos the variety of forms ceases to puzzle the investigator.</p>
<p>The Germans took first place after the break-up of the Carolingian Empire.
Their kings Henry the Fowler and Otto the Great held the Hungarian raids, which
ensured economic growth of Germany on both banks of the Rhine. The frontiers of
the domain were the Elbe and the Rhone; and in Italy they inherited the iron
crown of the Langobards. Otto II tried to conquer Byzantine Southern Italy but
did not succeed. Later the French Normans followed up his initiative, but they,
too, became the victims of the Germans in 1194.</p>
<p>During that time dynasties succeeded one another in Germany, the Saxon,
Franconian, and Swabian (Hohenstaufen), and in the thirteenth century the
Germans began to lose their position. The French took Languedoc from the German
Empire and part of Lorraine, while the Italians were able in general to separate
themselves from the 'animal race'. Politically this was a war of the emperors
with the Popes; socially it was a struggle of the feudal barons with the towns;
historically and culturally it was a rivalry of lawyers and prelates; and
ethnically it was the loss of reserves of drive by the leading tribe of the
Germans, the Swabians, and a peeling off of outliers associated with that.</p>
<p>In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Italians were the leading
ethnos of Catholic Europe. Profiting from the Crusades, the pillaging of
Byzantium, the trade with the East, and moneylending, they simultaneously
supplied all the kings of Europe with lawyers, diplomats, theologians, poets,
artists, builders, and navigators. The Venetians, no less flexible and
unscrupulous than the Florentines, the venal Romans, the cunning Bolognese, the
hypocritical Sienese, and the cut-throat Calabrians, successfully competed with
the Florentines, but the right to first place on the road to I fell, according
to Dante, belonged to the Genoese, who had insinuated themselves not only into
the Golden I Horde, but also into Rus for the sake of their trade deals; but,
true, they failed in that.</p>
<p>During the flourishing of the city republics of Italy, the other countries of
Europe suffered hard times.</p>
<p>England and France were at each other's throats, the English being supported
by the Gascons, and the French by the Scots. That war lasted a hundred years,
tied up the forces of both countries and bled them white. And even after it, as
the English left 'la belle France' (except for Calais), they switched the points
of their indefatigable passions against each other and began the Wars of the
Roses. These barons were so used to fighting and were so incapable of doing
anything else that 'Old England' knew no peace.</p>
<p>And then the hitherto little countries, the Czech Hussites and Swiss
mountaineers, bled Germany, Austria, and Burgundy. In short, almost all the
forces of Western Europe were closed on themselves and destroying each other.
Overheated drive made the 'Christian world' powerless, which very favourably
influenced the strengthening of Turkey and Russia, i.e. countries that had begun
their ascent in the fourteenth century and were consequently young in relation
to Europe.</p>
<p>A similar flourishing of drive is traceable in the eastern half of the
European superethnos, where the Slavs came into contacts with the Germans. In
the fifteenth century the Czech Hussites took the first step of the Reformation,
bleeding both Bohemia and neighbouring regions of Germany white. In the
sixteenth century first place passed to Poland, which had absorbed Lithuania and
become a pillar of the Counter-Reformation. It was that that ruined her, because
it deprived her of the possibility of establishing contact with Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>In the middle of the seventeenth century the Ukrainian Cossacks inflicted
several devastating defeats on the Polish troops; later the Swedes walked right
over the Poles and plucked them clean; and finally the Turks captured Podolia.
The heroic victory of 1673 saved Austria, but finally exhausted Poland, whose
decline in the eighteenth century is well known.</p>
<p>Sweden had the greatest successes in the seventeenth century, but that thinly
populated country drained its drive with Gustavus Adolphus in Germany, with
Charles X in Poland, and with Charles XII in Russia, and did not make good the
loss through growth of population. Enough children were born, but not of the
sort they used to be in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.</p>
<p>Here we must note that neither an economic nor a cultural decline was
observed in the Scandinavian and Slavonic lands, as also in the western duchies
of Germany, and in Austria and I Holland. In the eighteenth century almost all
European countries, having overcome the overheated drive of the acme phase,
developed their economics, built fine cities, traded with the whole world,
making vast profits, and patronized writers, artists, and scholars, i.e. gifted
people but not ones with extreme drive. That was the so-called age of the
Enlightenment. The optimum level of drive was reached in Europe through the
people with drive going to colonies and playing havoc there, without recalling
Voltaire, Rousseau, Kant, and Goethe.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, there was one country in Europe in the eighteenth century where
drive was rising. Doesnít that contradict the conception I have been
expounding? Let us go into it.</p>
<p>Germany suffered more than the other countries from the horrors of the
Reformation, the Counter-Reformation, and the Thirty Years' War. That was due to
drive having begun to fall there already in the thirteenth century (about which
I have written above); and because of that this rich and civilized country
became the victim of ethnoi with a high level of drive. Croats, Spaniards,
Walloons, Danes, Swedes, and French trampled Germany from end to end, while the
Germans, both Lutherans and Catholics, either suffered the violence of the
landsknechts or themselves joined their bands. Faith played no role in that;
they joined the commanders who paid best.</p>
<p>Since the Catholics were victorious in 1618 at the White Mountain, the
Protestants from Bohemia were compelled to seek safety by emigrating. Many of
them found asylum in the neighbouring Margravate of Brandenburg. There, too,
French Huguenots willingly settled, and also Polish 'Arians'. Berlin became a
refuge for persecuted, principled Protestants who brought drive with them.</p>
<p>The Brandenburg Mark had been founded on the land of the Slavonic tribe of
the Lyutichi (Veleti) and its population in the eighteenth century was mixed
(Germano-Slav). The import of drive had entailed a mixing of these ethnoi like
that which happened in England in the eleventh to thirteenth centuries.
Brandenburg, which became the Kingdom of Prussia, thus remained a phase of
ethnogenesis behind in relation to Western Germany and Austria. While everyone
around was 'enlightened', the Prussians still wanted to fight. They therefore
won the War of the Austrian Succession, the Seven Years' War, the war with
Napoleon I, and finally with Napoleon III, after which Prussia rose to head a
united Germany, excluding Austria and Luxembourg from it.</p>
<p>At the end of the fifteenth century Castile and Aragon were united, Grenada
was conquered by the Spaniards, and America (1492) and India (1498) discovered.
The forces of Spaniards and Portuguese with drive found application and the
tension of drive in the Iberian Peninsula fell to the optimum. That gave the
Hapsburgs, who had inherited the Spanish crown, an immense advantage. The whole
of the sixteenth century Spanish infantry went from victory to victory, Spanish
gold decided complicated matters of diplomacy, and the Spanish navy ruled the
waves. The brilliance of victory over the Turks at Lepanto (1571) softened the
bitterness of losing the war, especially since it was compensated by the defeat
of Venice. But the defeat of the Invincible Armada (1585) and the loss of
Holland (1,581), showed that the forces of Spain were not growing but were
diminishing. In the seventeenth century Spain suffered defeat after defeat. She
did not have the people either to reinforce the army and navy, or for the needs
of industry, or to defend her American possessions against French and English
pirates. And that was not because depopulation had set in Spain, but because
Spaniards simply fought worse and worked less. In 1048 the Spaniards resigned
themselves by the Peace of Westphalia to loss of hegemony in Europe, which
passed to France, and on the sea to Holland. But the Dutch domination did not
last long, since England was emerging. And then a new century of wars with
France began for England, which culminated in the Battle of Waterloo (1915),
after which the palm of Western Europe passed to her.</p>
<p>All the ethnoi known to ethnology have passed through this phase of ethnic
development, with the exception of those that perished in the preceding phases.
In Europe this phase coincided with the age of the Great Discoveries, the
Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Counter-Reformation. In Rome it was the
time of the conquests of Marius, Sulla, Pompeius, and Caesar, and also of the
civil wars. In Byzantium an analogous and hard period was the victories of the
Isaurian dynasty and iconoclasm. In the Arab Caliphate this age proved fatal;
the Caliphate fell apart, Spain and the Maghreb, Mavera-un-nahr (Central Asia)
and Khorasan broke away, and it lost connection with Egypt. Negro Zindji,
highcheekboned Turks, and desperate Dailarnites were fighting around Baghdad for
real power. The Arab were left only the. sphere of culture, but they prospered
considerably in it.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>In China.</font></i></b> In ancient China this was the age of the seven
'Warring States'. For clarity let me employ an illustrative analogy. Let me
compare China of the fourth century B.C. with Europe of the sixteenth century.
The Ch'in kingdom, which included the warlike Di tribes that inhabited the loess
valleys of Shensi and the jungles of Szechuan and which subjected them to the
harsh discipline of the doctrine of legalism (the School of Law), an analogue of
the Jesuit order, was the analogue of aggressive Spain, imbued with the
Mauritanian spirit. To France corresponded the rich, cultured, gay Chu country,
covered in the north by the blue Yangtse-kiang and in the south by impenetrable
jungles. Chu was Ch'in's most dangerous rival, counterposing the charm of
luxury, art, and freedom to the cruel soldiers' system. The heart of China, the
territory of the former Jin kingdom, and of the successor of the Chou empire,
broke up into three smallish kingdoms, Han, Wei, and Zhao. They corresponded to
the territory of Germany, also disunited and the heiress of the Holy Roman
Empire of the German nation. The Eastern Qi kingdom, located in Shantung, easily
compares with England, and the neglected Yan kingdom in Liaotung with Sweden or
Denmark. The situations with such a distribution of forces were analogous:
Spain, heading the Counter-Reformation, wanted to subordinate all Europe to
herself, but fortunately for herself, was not successful; Ch'in, with its
doctrine of legalism, conquered all China in the third century B.C., unluckily
for itself.</p>
<p>Imagine for a minute that Philip II had succeeded in such a conquest of
Europe. What would have happened? The Inquisition throughout Europe, Spanish
garrisons in Paris, Geneva, London, Stockholm, and Venice, for which all the
youths of Spain would have been insufficient. Vast outlays on army and police,
because it would have been necessary to hold the front against Turkey, and that
would have meant exhausting taxes, which would have evoked universal popular
hatred. And at the first convenient moment a universal uprising of the peoples,
who would not have spared the conquerors. Spain avoided such a fate, but that
was precisely what happened with the Ch'in kingdom in 207 B.C. Ch'in never
revived (lien, and China, bled white, was easily united by the first capable
pretender. Such proved to be the peasant Liu Pang who gave tile empire built on
the ruins the name of I Han. There can be different outcomes in similar
situations.</p>
<p>Mediaeval China, which arose on the ruins of the old, just as the
ëChristian worldí of Western Europe arose on the ruins of ancient Rome, took
shape as an ethnic entity in the sixth century A.D. and reached an analogous
phase in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. A different fate befell it. The
brilliant culture of the Sung epoch became the prey, under a loathsome
administration and a demoralized government, of foreigners (Tanguts, Jurchens,
and Mongols). In contrast to the Arab Caliphate and the Arabic-speaking Muslim
ethnos, China revived under the Ming dynasty, but that was already another phase
of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>As it is clear from these examples, and all the others do not contradict
them, it is difficult to consider the acme phase of drive 'flourishing'. In all
known cases the sense of the phenomenon consists in a squandering of the wealth
and glory accumulated by ancestors. Yet, in all textbooks, in all surveys, in
all the multi-volume 'histories' of art or literature, and in all historical
novels, the descendants glory precisely in this phase, knowing full well that,
alongside Leonardo da Vinci, Savonarola spread terror, and Benvenuto Cellini
himself shot the traitor and vandal the Constable Bourbon.</p>
<p>Obviously, a broad range of deeds, from feats to crimes, work on the
aesthetic strings of the spirit of the investigator or novelist, and it is
characteristic of a man to remember the bright bands of the spectrum and forget
the dark patches. It is for this reason that they call these terrible epochs
'flourishing'.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Victims of blossoming.</font></i></b><i> </i>In the early sixteenth century
and in the seventeenth the percentage of people with drive in Europe fell, and
that of people with sub-drive rose, through destruction of the conservative part
of the population, the harmonious persons, the most industrious and law-abiding.
The system of the superethnos lost stability, because the individual people with
drive could easily enlist mercenaries from the people with sub-drive. Which they
did; now as preachers (Luther, Calvin, Savonarola, John of Leyden), now as
condottieri (Maurice of Saxony, Mansfeld, Wallenstein), and now as kings who
broke the laws of their kingdoms (the Tudor, Henry VIII). Whereas such attempts
had previously immediately came up against the resistance of others with drive,
now, when these had become fewer, a broad field opened before each, and also,
consequently, an opportunity to gather inertia. The clashes of (lie epoch of the
Reformation and Counter-Reformation therefore acquired great scope and cost even
more victims The single system broke apart and people began to seek friends so
as not to fall into the clutches of enemies. And since it was senseless to
appeal to the rulers for aid, the principle of complementariness came into
force, according to which sincere friends were sought who were recompensed with
sincerity because that was the most reliable insurance.</p>
<p>But these unhappy people could not help seeking unity for self-defense, after
the Duc de Guise burned a barn where Huguenots sang psalm, and Joan of Navarre
threw Catholics who went to mass into an underground dungeon, and the English
king Henry VIII hanged a Catholic (because he held the Pope in esteem) and a
Calvinist (because he denied the sanctity of the mass) on one gibbet. Cynical
rulers were more terrible than infidels because they had at their disposal
executioners and informers without faith, honour, and conscience (people with
sub-drive).</p>
<p>But the rulers could not get along without sincerely true servants, which
meant they had to go along with one of the two unifying ideologies,
Protestantism or reformed Catholicism, because only a memory remained of
traditional Catholicism. So the Catholic League and the Protestant Union were
formed, and the Thirty Years' War was fought that cost Germany three-quarters of
its population. Other countries suffered less, but also considerably. But, alas,
not only ideological or political opponents of secular and spiritual rulers died
in this phase of ethnogenesis.</p>
<p>During the Renaissance manslaughter was an everyday occupation of the
inhabitants of Western Europe and on a mass scale moreover. It was not so much
thinkers, poets, and philosophers who were the object of persecution then,
though they too came in for it (Michael Servetus was burned in Geneva and
Giordano Bruno in Rome) as ordinary, innocent people with imagination. They were
declared sorcerers and witches and pitilessly burned. And here is what is worthy
of note. Training in witchcraft and magically induced illness was already
considered superstition among the Germans in the eighth and ninth centuries A.D.
Therefore the laws of the Langobard kings treated accusing a woman of flying on
a broomstick as a slander for which the informer was punished and put into
prison. <a name="ebe6text36"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note36">[+36]</a>
Under Charlemagne even the death penalty was proposed for such a denunciation.
In the ninth century the witch's sabbath was declared an illusion of informers
at a council, although certain bishops, like Isidore of Seville, Rabanus Maurus,
and Hincmar, the Archbishop of Reims, accepted the idea of lamias.</p>
<p>This humane legislation was not inherited from civilized Rome, which was
nearing the phase of obscuration. There sorcerers had either been exiled or
executed. No, this was the common sense of people with drive who were building a
life for their descendants. It would have been stupid, if they had not been
concerned that their grandsons should not become the victims of slanders and
tyranny.</p>
<p>But why did persecution of sorcerers arise in imperial Rome? In republican,
still semi-barbarian Rome they were not interested in witchcraft, but when the
wave of luxurious civilization arrived from the conquered East, hatred of
intellect streamed in together with it. Jewish rabbis of the first century A.D.
prescribed destruction of sorcerers (the Talmud). In the middle of the second
century Apuleius popularized a psychosis of fear of Thessalian sorceresses. And
persecution of fortune-tellers had already developed at the end of the second
century simultaneously with the persecution of Christians. That period in Rome
coincided with the inertial phase of ethnogenesis on the eve of the transition
to obscuration. Europe outdid Rome. Trials of witches began in the fifteenth
century; and no one, moreover, accused these unfortunate women of heresy and
righting the Church. They were burned because they were not like others.</p>
<p>Thus, in the 'dark years of the Middle Ages' defenseless creative people,
dreamers, and naturalists could live quietly in peace time; during the feudal
wars they undoubtedly suffered, but in common with fellow-citizens. But as soon
as the epoch of humanism set in, the epoch of religious and philosophical quest,
the epoch of great discoveries ñ what then? The sixteenth century came, the
High Renaissance, the Reformation, and the Second Inquisition, which struggled
not against Cathars, enemies of the Church, but against defenseless romancers
and dreamers and people who knew folk medicine. In this Catholics and
Protestants made a common front. However strange it may seem, the most burnings
over an equal interval of time were in New England rather than Spain. This shows
that the reason for executions lay not in the dogmas of faith but in a
psychological shift, a lowering of the level of drive of the superethnic system.
As soon as an inflection of the curve of ethnogenesis was completed, the
execution of witches began to be an anachronism to the Philistines. And so
everywhere where the ethnos reached this change of phase.</p>
<p>The fervor of the Philistine is usually fruitless because it comes up against
a well-ordered legal procedure under which a critical attitude to denunciations
is obligatory. But the inquisitors Jacob Sprenger and Heinrich Institoris
themselves were Philistines in their psychological pattern, endowed with
extraordinary authority. They knew very well that it was fraught with
unpleasantness for themselves if they accused a noble person of witchcraft. They
therefore seized, tortured, and burned defenseless women denounced by
neighbours. There came about a kind of genocide; honest people, with an aversion
to the trade of denunciation, and talented people who evoked envy, were
destroyed, while morally unscrupulous dunces multiplied, who gave rise to the
generation of European Philistines characteristic of the nineteenth century.
That was a statistical process and therefore irreversible.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>Splitting of the ethnic ëfieldí.</font></i></b> At the end of the Thirty
Years' War (1618-1648), there was weariness. But that did not result in unity.
For 150 years both Protestants and Catholics developed different stereotypes of
behaviour which could only be combined through tolerance. The latter was
proclaimed as a principle but was very inconsistently realized. Only in the
eighteenth century were old scores forgotten and Europe again acquired a unity,
which was called the 'civilized world' rather than the 'Christian'. But even
that equilibrium was achieved at the price of a lowering of the drive of the
superethnos, which came about relatively painlessly for Europe itself: the
people with drive and those with sub-drive (mercenaries) were sent to overseas
colonies.</p>
<p>Three Catholic countries (Spain, Portugal, and France) and two Protestant
ones (England and Holland) carried on an active colonial policy. For clarity,
let us agree on terms. When peasants who wanted to work with their own hands in
the new land seized by them went from these countries, that was colonization.
When soldiers, officials, and traders went, aspiring to make a fortune from the
subordinated country, that was colonialization.</p>
<p>Which was worse for the local population is another question. The
consequences of the split in the single field of the European superethnos that
was manifested in the religious wars of the Protestants and Catholics affected
that. During the colonization of America it was noted that the Spaniards and
French entered into contacts with the Indians relatively easily, though not with
all of them, while the Anglo-Saxons did not know how to establish relations,
except purely diplomatic ones (for example, with the Iroquois in the seventeenth
century) and organized scalp-hunting, paying bounties for dead Indians. Allow me
to suggest a theoretical answer.</p>
<p>The Spaniards, French, and English were ethnoi that were and had hitherto
been part of the Romano-German superethnos. But within that entity they were
very unlike one another in their ethnopsychological dominant. The colonization
of America coincided with the Reformation, i.e. with a complete reorganization
of the psychological structure in the phase of the historical existence of the
superethnos. The structure was simplified and the energy thereby liberated
gushed out beyond the limits of the West-European geobiocoenosis, within which
the separate variants of the culture were isolated from one another. Not only
Protestants but also Catholics after the Council of Trent, became unlike their
ancestors, because Savonarola, Piccolomini, and Loyola did no less for
ethnocultural deformation than Martin Luther or Calvin. The isolation of nations
is thus a natural product of ethnogenesis, but the divergence of stereotypes of
behaviour is its inevitable consequence.</p>
<p>Different stereotypes determined the different attitude of the European
colonists to the Indians.</p>
<p>The Spaniards saw the caciques of the local tribes as nobles, and after
baptism gave them the title 'Don'. As a consequence, a significant part of the
Indians in Mexico and Peru were assimilated. The French in Canada were attracted
by the Indian way of life, and by the nineteenth century they had borrowed much
from the Indian tribes. During the Riel rebellion the metises and the Indians
acted together. The Anglo-Saxons drove the Indians into reservations except for
those who agreed to the American way of life.</p>
<p>With application of my proposed conception it may be supposed that there was
a consonance in the rhythms of the Catholic ethnoi with the Indians, but not
with those who chose Protestantism in Europe. And indeed, in the sixteenth
century, almost all the nations of Europe were divided into Catholics and
Protestants, and each, moreover, chose the stereotype suitable for it.</p>
<p>Let us check. Great Russians mixed with Tatars and Buryats who adopted
Russian culture to a significant extent, and easily dissolved among the Yakuts,
but the Ugrian peoples preserved their distinctiveness in spite of long, close,
friendly intercourse with Slavs. But the Russians did not come to an
understanding with the Indians in Alaska and in California, and were unable to
consolidate themselves there in spite of the support of the Aleuts and Eskimos.
And it was not by chance that during the Thirty Years' War Russia supported the
Protestant Union against the Catholic League, took Protestant Germans into her
service, and traded with Holland. Yet Catholicism was closer in dogmas and
rituals to Orthodoxy than Protestantism. The ethnic element evidently
predominated over the ideological here too.</p>
<p>The Protestants who went to South Africa (Dutch, French Huguenots, and
Germans) took shape as an ethnos called 'Boers'. These were most intolerant to
the aborigines. Slavery was abolished in the Transvaal only in 1901. But the
French in Haiti taught the Negro slaves French and the Catholic religion. The
Negro cur6s interpreted the latter in their own way. In 1792, when the British
navy was blockading revolutionary France, the Negroes rose in rebellion against
the French planters, motivating their attitude to them as follows: 'God came to
the whites, but the whites killed God. We shall avenge God ñ we shall kill the
whites'. And they killed all the Frenchmen on the colony.</p>
<p>All the same that was not estrangement, but a form of ideological contact at
superethnic level. Now the Haitian Negroes revived the Dahomeyan cult of Voodoo,
serpent-worship, among themselves, but admitted only Catholics, including
Europeans, to the mysteries.</p>
<p>One can conclude from these observations that the Reformation was not so much
a revolt of an idea as a phase of ethnogenesis, a break that was formed during
the transition from the acme phase to the inertial.</p>
<b><i><font COLOR="#ff0000">
<p>The break and its significance.</font></i></b> It follows from what I have
said that the phases of ethnogenesis differ only in degree of variety and
diversity determined by the level of drive. There are always people of the
sub-drive characteristic of homeostasis, but with the rise of several
generations of people with drive they lose their exceptional significance in the
established system, and are then simply not noticed. During the upward swing the
role of harmonious people who conscientiously do their duty grows. And they do
not disappear in the acme phase when, with an overheating of drive, the
individuals with most drive perish one after another. After this, the
significance of harmonious individuals again rises in the inertial phase, but
diminishes rapidly in the phase of obscuration when, together with quiet people
of sub-drive inherited by the ethnos from its substrata, there appear violent
mercenaries ('wandering soldiers'), a product of the residue of the acme phase.
These types easily make short work of the harmonious individuals and simplify
the system right to loss of resistance. Then they themselves perish, and, as a
result of the collapse of the ethnos, its inimitable culture is forgotten and
homeostasis sets in.</p>
<p>This ethno-social pattern is traceable as well in the ethno-geographical
material. The characteristics of the phases coincide.</p>
<p>An ethnos, during its creation, hews the landscape to its needs and at the
same time adapts itself to the conditions of the terrain; in short, the
principle of feedback operates here, by which nature suffers minimally. In the
acme phase, when the ethnic system swells with energy, a time of conquests and
migrations sets in, the former being limited by the resistance of neighbours,
and the latter as well by the natural conditions. Nature suffers doubly. In
their native land it is boring for the people with drive to till the soil. They
prefer more difficult but also more attractive modes of existence and
flourishing. The pressure of civilization on nature is reduced but, since a
negative growth of population is often associated with these stormy periods, the
economy also falls into a decline, as a consequence of which there is a
restoration of the natural landscapes (forests, steppe, and marshes) and also of
the population of wild animals.</p>
<p>But on the other hand countries conquered by people with drive suffer very
heavily. Those ethnoi become victims of conquest, as a rule, in which the level
of drive is low, which prevents them from organizing an effective defense. They
themselves, therefore, and the wealth of their countries, including the products
of nature, become the booty of the victors.</p>
<p>Suffice it to recall the 'gold fleets' of the Spaniards, carrying gold from
Mexico and Peru, or the silver mines of Potosi (Bolivia), which became the grave
of countless numbers of Indians. And the Portuguese plantations in Brazil can
only be compared with the Dutch colonies in Java and the other Sunda Islands. In
both thousands of Malays and Negro slaves perished so as to convert luxurious
groves on the hills of Portugal and the meadows of the Netherlands into the
estates of businessmen and magnates who were not afraid of risk for the sake of
this splendour and glitter, and did not spare either others or themselves. The
fur companies of Canada almost completely exterminated the beavers, to save
which it has been necessary to create game preserves. In East Africa elephant
hunters wiped out whole herds just to get money for the ivory tusks sold on the
London market.</p>
<p>It was the same in antiquity. In China the rhinoceros was wiped out; in
Khotan the surface deposits of nephrite were worked out. But enough of examples.
Let us look at the matter from the other side.</p>
<p>However ferocious conquerors with drive showed themselves to be, they did
limited harm to nature. They took only what lay on the surface, what they had to
fight for but not to work for. Therefore, after their victorious campaigns,
there remained restorable biocoenoses, and heavily battered but not exterminated
tribes of Indians, Negroes, Polynesians, and Papuans. The people with drive
themselves risked their lives eve minute.</p>
<p>The social imperative with a change of phases from an upsurge of drive to a
lowering of its level in an ethnos can be formulated as follows: 'We are tired
of the great'. The standard of brilliance of ethnic populations is therefore
lowered artificially, it not entering anyone's head that the power of the state
and the ethnos' degree of resistance were being lowered thereby.</p>
<p>We have already seen that, in a number of cases, this led to disastrous
consequences, but it was useful to the Romano-German integrity of Western
Europe. Western Europe was a peninsula of the Eurasian continent. The sea
defended it on three sides. There was danger only in the south-east where the
Turks, having broken Byzantium carried out a broad offensive in the sixteenth
and seventeenth centuries. Hungary fell. It was the turn of Italy and Germany
next. And then heroic Poland, the most backward <a name="ebe6text37"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note37">[+37]</a>
of the countries of Western Europe, and therefore preserving comparatively large
dose of drive, sacrificed herself. Jan Sobieski's hussars saved Vienna in 1683.
By shedding their blood for Germany, the Poles prepared the partition of their
own country. When the reverse bend in Germany finished, and the inertial phase
set in with national consolidation, Europe again became invulnerable and
aggressive, but very little like herself in the preceding period. She had been
converted from 'chivalrous' into 'commercially-minded', and I must speak
specially about that. But now let us return to Jaspers' conception, or rather to
the views of West-European philosophers of history. They all, beginning with St.
Augustine, have seen a direction and sense in history. All oriental thinkers saw
rises and falls in history, in other words, considered the processes as an end
in themselves, and believed the sense to be personal improvement with history
only a background.</p>
<p>The difference was evidently not a chance one. In my view, it is that
Westerners talk about progress created by human hands, i.e. the technosphere, in
which one must also include philosophy, also the product of human activity,
while oriental sages talked about living nature, of which people are a part, and
technique the background. Let me translate that into scientific terms: in the
West they studied socio-cultural history, in the East ethnic history, often
simply genealogy. And one cannot say that the one is more important than the
other. Both are necessary. It is bad only when the methods of sociology are
applied to the study of natural phenomena. It is good that the reverse does not
happen.</p>
<p>I could end the dispute with Jaspers and other teleological systems of
religion and progress on that. Two leading factors are involved in ethnic
processes, viz., loss of the inertia of the initial impulse, i.e. aging, and the
forceful, violent effect of neighbouring ethnoi or other forces of nature, <a name="ebe6text38"></a><a href="ebe6b.htm#ebe6note38">[+38]</a>
i.e. displacement. The latter always deforms the ethnogenesis programmed by
nature herself, but displacement can only be catastrophic at moments of reverse
or downward bending.</p>
