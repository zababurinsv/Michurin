<h3><a name="sik4para10">10. The Tastes and Sympathies of the Author of the Secret
History</a></h3>
<h4>Causefor Doubt</h4>
<p>Despite the fact that the problem of the creation and
destruction of Chinggiskhan's power has excited many historians, it has still
not been solved. There is no answer to the first and most important question in
the numerous general and special works: how did it happen that a poor orphan,
deprived of support even by his own tribe which had plundered and deserted him,
became leader of a mighty army, khan of several peoples and conqueror of all the
neighbouring states although they were much mightier than he?  <a name="sik4text1"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note1">[+1]</a></p>
<p>In our brief excursus we try to answer this question; for
with a panoramic view of Asia's history it is clear that the disappearance of
the legend of the Kingdom of Prester John and the decline of the Nestorian
church within the Mongol ulus are linked with the turn of events that
accompanied the rise of Chinggiskhan. This particularly concerns a most
important subject - the formation of the Mongol state prior to the great
kuriltai of 1206, since the Mongols` external wars have been studied with
greater detail and precision.</p>
<p>Two thirteenth-century works were devoted to a description of
this period: <i>Alton depter </i>(The Golden Book) and <i>Yuan-chao-bi-shi </i>(The
Secret History of the Mongols). The first is an official history which has gone
through strict government censorship; the second is a work composed in 1240 and
devoted to describing the same events, but predominantly the internal history of
the Mongol people which, evidently, corresponded to the author's interests and
the aim he had set himself. What was this aim and who was the author? - that is
the problem we have posed.</p>
<p>In approaching an authentic narrative source, the personal
qualities and trend of thought of the ancient author are no less <b><font COLOR="#943634">{222}
</font></b>significant than his social allegiance or political
orientation. More than that, one determines the other and it becomes so
interwoven that it is inseparable. It is still more important to make clear for
what purpose and for whose sake the source was written and to what extent one
may rely on it. If the author is not gifted, it is easy for the historian to
understand, but the <i>Yuan-chao-bi-shi </i>is as much a work of genius as the
Lay of Igor's Host, and it is very difficult to determine where the author is
leading and what corrections should be made to restore the true course of
events. Here is a question of cardinal importance. If we knew the biography and
personal connections of the author, then all would be simple, but we do not even
know his name.</p>
<p>B.I. Pankratov allows just two hypotheses: a record from the
words of an eye-witness and a collective work.  <a name="sik4text2"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note2">[+2]</a> Yet it is still more important
to establish the genre and the political tendency of the work itself; but here,
too, there is no common opinion as is seen from the various translations of the
book's title: The Concealed Tale  <a name="sik4text3"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note3">[+3]</a> and The Secret History.  <a name="sik4text4"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note4">[+4]</a> This is not quite
the same thing.  <a name="sik4text5"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note5">[+5]</a></p>
<p>The researchers are equally contradictory as regards the
political trend of the work:  <a name="sik4text6"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note6">[+6]</a> V.V. Bartol'd considered it an apologia for the
aristocracy, S.A. Kozinfor democracy, B.Ya. Vladimirtsov wrote that its aim was
&quot;to make a secret tradition of the house of Chinggiskhan, of his history,
since the tale is really a treasured source of stories about dark events taking
place within a single clan, a single family, a single bloodline&quot;. On the
contrary, the present day Mongolian scholars Ts. Damdinsuren and M. Gaadamba
consider that the author's idea amounts to a substantiation of the need to unite
the Mongol tribes and to advocate the triumph of feudalism over clan structure.
As we see, the difference of opinion is extreme, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{223}
</font></b>but only V.V. Bartol'd and G. E. Grumm-Grzhimailo  <a name="sik4text7"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note7">[+7]</a>
pose the question of the reliability of the source, though they do not propose a
solution to the problem.</p>
<p>It seems to me extremely dubious that the author of the
Secret History dealt in such concepts as &quot;feudalism&quot; and &quot;clan
structure&quot;, or even &quot;aristocracy&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot;.
Rather, he had personal sympathies and antipathies to particular Chinggisids
when in 1240 he composed his tale of past days. It was these sympathies which
determined the trend he strove to pursue, with frequent harm to the truth.</p>
<p>As distinct from the Secret History, the official history of
the Mongols entitled Collection of Chronicles has an author whose biography is
well known. This does not, of course, mean that the history of the creation of
this source, its methodological and compositional features are clear, and the
reliability of its information is undoubted. Rather the contrary, too much here
leads one to reflect and gives rise to doubt.</p>
<p>Rashid ad-Din was an educated man who had made an
administrative career under the Ilkhans Ghazan and Oljeitu. He grew fabulously
rich: a quarter of the town of Tebriz belonged to him, with its stalls,
caravansarai, workshops and gardens; he had enormous estates and, apart from
that, an unlimited amount of money because he was in charge of the finances of
the Ilkhan state. In 1298 he became Vizir, i.e. head of the government, and his
family demanded care and attention. It is easy to imagine that Rashid ad-Din was
very busy, but a historical investigation is a laborious matter.</p>
<p>And then, amidst all his daily cares, Rashid ad-Din received
the command to compose a &quot;history of the Mongols&quot;, and a better one
than there had ever been. Probably he himself conceived the idea: to begin with
the creation of the world, to cover the countries of the Franks and the Chinese
and crown this magnificent edifice with a detailed description of the creation
and flourishing of the Mongol Empire, to glorify Chinggiskhan and take the tale
to its zenith - the reign of his protector, Oljeitu-qan.</p>
<p>The concept was truly grandiose, but Rashid ad-Din was in the
position of Raisky in Goncharov's novel, <i>The Precipice, </i>i.e. he had <b><font COLOR="#943634">{224}
</font></b>the ideas and the desire, but had neither time, nor
the habit of dealing with the material, did not know the methods of historical
criticism and, consequently, could not distinguish reliable versions from
distorted ones In short, the great financier did not know how to write history.</p>
<p>But this did not bother him. At that time in Persia there
were many unemployed educated men The vizir invited them and entrusted them to
collect the materials, which they did Then these materials and notes, without
being collated and without their reliability being checked, were filed,
interleaved and presented to the Ilkhan who also failed to go into the text, but
simply rewarded the compiler  <a name="sik4text8"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note8">[+8]</a> The poor men who had dealt with various sections
fell into despair, for the raw material had been passed off as the finished
production Some, for example Kashani,  <a name="sik4text9"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note9">[+9]</a> complained of plagiarism, but in vain
No one wanted to listen But after the vizir had fallen into disgrace, been
executed and the Ilkhan empire had rapidly begun to fall apart, there was no
mention of correcting historical works There was no need for that So we got not
a &quot;history&quot; and not even a &quot;chronicle&quot;, but a collection of
materials, in great part contradictory.</p>
<p>Identical events are dealt with differently in different
parts of the book, and we do not know which versions are to be preferred But
perhaps even this is all right, because twentieth-century historians are able to
process the primary material without expending enormous efforts to overcome the
philosophical conceptions of the thirteenth century which have long lost their
relevance But we must not avoid another difficulty not overcome by the compiler
of the Collection of Chronicles, checking all the versions adduced by internal
and comparative criticism.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Search for a Way Out</h4>
<p>First of all, we must note that the Secret History differs
very much in its treatment and exposition of events from the official history,
the <i>Altan depter </i>(The Golden Book) the Mongol text of which has <b><font COLOR="#943634">{225}
</font></b>not survived but which is the basis for Rashid
ad-Din's  <a name="sik4text10"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note10">[+10]</a> Collection of Chronicles and for the <i>Yuan-shi, </i>the Chinese
history of the Mongol dynasty.  <a name="sik4text11"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note11">[+11]</a> By establishing the agreements in both works
we can restore the content of the lost source.</p>
<p>For our purpose, we do not have to compare both versions, the
secret and the official, fully. It is enough merely to point to some
disagreements to show that they were written independently. Thus, the battle at
Dalan-baljut, according to the &quot;official&quot; history, ended in the
complete victory of Chinggiskhan,  <a name="sik4text12"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note12">[+12]</a> but, according to the &quot;Secret&quot;
one,  <a name="sik4text13"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note13">[+13]</a> in his defeat which Jamuqa somehow did not make use of. The abduction
of Borte is described differently by Rashid ad-Din and in the Secret History.
 <a name="sik4text14"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note14">[+14]</a> The execution of Jamuqa is ascribed by Rashid ad-Din to Elchidei-noyan who
chopped Jamuqa into pieces, but in the Secret History Chinggiskhan strives to
save Jamuqa's life and only at Jamuqa's insistence does he allow him to die
&quot;without bloodshed&quot;, i.e. with great honour.  <a name="sik4text15"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note15">[+15]</a> One could give many
more examples of disagreement, but it is enough merely to add that the features
of historical persons are at times diametrically opposed. For example, Jamuqa is
depicted in the &quot;official&quot; history as an unprincipled adventurer, but
in the Secret one as a patriot and true friend of Chinggiskhan who was only
forced into the struggle by circumstances and intrigues; moreover, even in the
enemy camp Jamuqa is more concerned about Chinggiskhan's interests than his own
(ßß 170, 195, 200). The differing trends of the sources are quite clear.</p>
<p>It is too soon to pose the question of who is right, the
&quot;official&quot; or the Secret History. Both were written in a period of
intense struggle between various groupings within the Mongol Empire and,
undoubtedly, reflected this struggle. Consequently, both distorted the truth,
but in different ways. There is only one way to answer the question which
interests us concerning the bias of the author of the Secret History - to
investigate the source along four lines: (1) the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{226}
</font></b>chronological sequence of events; (2) the constructive
principle of the literary work, i.e. to establish its genre; (3) the features of
historical persons from the author's viewpoint; (4) the author's political
sympathies in 1240, i.e. when the work was written.</p>
<p>Only by critical analysis can we answer the question posed
and determine the reliability of the source, without which all historical and
sociological considerations of the part played by Chinggiskhan will depend on
the whim of the researcher and, consequently, cannot claim to be acceptable as
scholarship. After all, everything in the history of Chinggiskhan's rise is
doubtful, starting with the date of his birth. Rashid ad-Din noted this himself,
allowing glaring contradictions in determining this basic date: at first he says
that Chinggiskhan was born in the year of the pig, corresponding to A.H. 547
(A.D. 1152/3), but then determining Chinggiskhan's age at his death (August
1227) as 72, i.e. giving him the birth-date of 1155.  <a name="sik4text16"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note16">[+16]</a> There is an undoubted
muddle here and, evidently, the dating in the <i>Yuan-shi </i>is more reliable,
which allots Chinggiskhan's birth to the year of the horse, 1161.  <a name="sik4text17"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note17">[+17]</a> Mongol
tradition gives the date of 1162, but the difference is only a matter of months
because of the differing calendars.  <a name="sik4text18"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note18">[+18]</a> We shall see below why one should prefer
this date.</p>
<p>In Temujin's life periods of differing importance are to be
distinguished. The first period is his childhood before the death of his father
which occurred when Temujin was nine (ß 61),  <a name="sik4text19"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note19">[+19]</a> i.e. 1171.  <a name="sik4text20"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note20">[+20]</a> Naturally,
in this period there were no events in his life which would be reflected in
history.</p>
<p>The second period is his adolescence until Tarqutai-kiriltuq,
the Tayichi'ut, captured Temujin who then fled from him. The Secret History
gives only one fact from this period: the killing of Bekter by Temujin and Qasar
(ßß 76-8) and then incidentally it recalls that Temujin made friends with
Jamuqa when he was 11 (ß 116), i.e. in <b><font COLOR="#943634">{227}
</font></b>1173. However, we may suppose that something more
significant occurred in this period.</p>
<p>In fact, the Tayichi'ut attacked the Borjigin not for
plunder, but only to seize Temujin and, having done this, they left. Tarqutai
&quot;subjected him to the rightful punishment&quot;. What for? Clearly, Temujin
had done something, not very harmful, because he was not to be killed, but
something quite definite.</p>
<p>This is not a continuation of the old quarrel as a result of
the departure of the Tayichi'ut since subsequently Tarqutai-kiriltuq, seized by
slaves wanting to hand him over, tells his brothers and sons intending to
liberate him that he educated and admonished Temujin when he was orphaned, and
adds: &quot;They say he is coming to his senses and his thoughts are sorting
themselves out ... No, Temujin will not destroy me&quot; (ß 149).</p>
<p>Here the source's author lets the cat out of the bag about
events which he has assiduously hushed up: Temujin's unknown deed for which a
cangue was put on him was held to be a childish prank, stupid mischief, because
he was spared. But the Tayichi'ut elders overlooked the spark of imperiousness
that was beginning to appear and which the batrak Sorgan-shira  <a name="sik4text21"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note21">[+21]</a> noted when he
saved Temujin from capture and which the author of the source suppressed. Why he
had to do this we shall see below.</p>
<p>It is difficult to date this happening. For some reason it is
accepted in the literature that Chinggis was 16 at this time, i.e. 1178, but
there is no confirmation of this in the source.</p>
<p>The third period is his young manhood and poses still greater
difficulties. The next fact, his marriage to Borte, is dated by the ages of
members of the Borjigin family. The basic date is the death of the eldest son,
Jochi, who was born in the year of the Merkit raid, as a result of which he was
suspected of being illegitimate.</p>
<p>Jochi died in 1227, being thirty-odd years old. That means
the Merkit raid was about 1190, and Temujin was then 28-30, but, on <b><font COLOR="#943634">{228}
</font></b>the other hand, his second son, Ogedei, was 56 in
1241,  <a name="sik4text22"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note22">[+22]</a> i.e. he was born in 1185.</p>
<p>We know from Mongol tradition that the year when Temujin was
first chosen as Chinggiskhan was that of the snow leopard and that one and a
half years separated it from the year when Borte was liberated and,
consequently, from the year when Jochi was born. Since Jochi was older than
Ogedei this year could not be 1194, so it was 1182 and that means the
counter-raid on the Merkit was about 1180 Proceeding from these dates we can
regard the dates of birth for Temujin by Rashid ad-Din, 1152 and 1155, as
completely improbable. It is known that Temujin married Borte having reached his
majority, i.e. 16 Consequently (even taking the late date), this took place in
1171, i.e. nine years before the birth of his eldest child Is such a thing
possible? Yet if we take the date of the <i>Yuan-shi, </i>which goes back to the
Mongol <i>Altan depter, </i>i.e. the official history, the date of the marriage
falls in 1178-9 and it is natural to expect the birth of a son a year or a year
and a half later. Then, it is known that Chinggiskhan personally made long
campaigns, i.e. in the saddle, to the end of his life It is scarcely likely that
he could without trouble cross the scorching deserts at 72, but one can imagine
this was within his ability at 65. Probability and the lack of contradiction
speaks for the Mongol chronology, but both its incongruity and two mutually
incompatible dates are against the Persian source. We have given so much
attention to this question, for the whole chronology of the late twelfth century
has so far been of a conditional nature and, in our view, has not corresponded
to reality. The starting point for an investigation of the chronology are the
dates of Temujin's birth and marriage. On this foundation we have given a
corrected chronology of events above and have not once encountered
contradictions in the interpretation of facts or their sequence.</p>
<p>If this is so, then the history of the Mongols at the end of
the twelfth century takes on the features outlined above. It was extremely rich,
i.e. the Tayichi'ut captivity, flight from it, the Merkit raid, the Mongol
counter-raid, friendship with Jamuqa and choice as khan, the events grouped
together in the interval between 1178 and 1182. And here the author of the
source allows himself a slip which is extremely valuable to us Jamuqa says, in
proposing the disposition for the counter-raid on the Merkit &quot;On the way
from <b><font COLOR="#943634">{229} </font></b>here,
upstream along the Onon there are people who belong to the ulus of my <i>anda </i>[i.e.
Temujin]. One host will be formed from the ulus of my <i>anda. </i>Another host
from here will be two hosts in all&quot; (ß 106).  <a name="sik4text23"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note23">[+23]</a> But not only Bo'orchu and
Jelme attached themselves to Temujin, there were some other people subordinate
to him, even though nominally. This is an enormous step compared with the time
when Yisugei's orphans fed themselves on wild garlic and marmots, but the author
prefers not to note it although he alone could explain to us the sudden hatred
between the Tayichi'ut and Temujin.</p>
<p>The fourth period, maturity, may be limited by 1201, the year
of the cock, when the errors in the source move from chronology to other
spheres. 1201 was a year of civil war in Mongolia; it had been started by a
confederation of tribes, evidently, disturbed and alarmed by Chinggiskhan's
energetic policy. But the source gives no answer as to what this policy was.
Only three events occur in all these 18 years&quot;. Temujin's quarrel with
Jamuqa, the campaign against the Tatars and the reprisal against the laggard
clan of Jurkin. These events are dated by the year of the dog which started on 1
Jumad578,i.e. in September 1181. Consequently, they took place soon after
Temujin had been chosen khan, i.e. about 1183.  <a name="sik4text24"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note24">[+24]</a> The remaining 16 years, i.e.
the period when Temujin changed from a petty princeling to a claimant not only
for the throne of Mongolia, but also for the whole Great Steppe, the period
which is the key to understanding all the subsequent grandiose conquests, the
period of the break in the Mongols&quot; social relations and psychology, this
period is not reflected in the Secret History at all. It is simply omitted.</p>
<p>Author's ignorance is excluded since from ß 120, i.e. from
1182, he replaces the pronoun &quot;they&quot; by &quot;we&quot;, showing that
he participated in the events. So, he again left out events about which he did
not want to speak for some reason. Rashid ad-Din had called attention to this
strange circumstance.  <a name="sik4text25"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note25">[+25]</a> Evidently, the &quot;official&quot; history hushed up
the same events as the Secret one. In this case the trends of both versions
coincide; but where an event is described (for <b><font COLOR="#943634">{230}
</font></b>example, the battle at Dalan-baljut) the versions are
diametrically opposed. Here we have come up against the basic problem - the
direction in which the author of the Secret History was tending with regard to
the main actor, Temujin Chinggiskhan. By establishing the direction of the
source we shall be able to understand what sort of distortion of events the
author of the account allowed or consciously introduced into the text.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Problem of Genre</h4>
<p>First of all, it is essential to note that although the
author of the Secret History used many tales, traditions and personal
recollections, he so creatively fused them that the single plan of the work
suffered no harm. Some of the materials had been little reworked, for example,
the list of noyans, or the military articles for the guard, or the folklore
insertions in the form of direct speech, the praise of the Onggirat women from
the lips of Dai-sechen, of the Mongol army from the lips of Jamuqa. In the first
case the author has striven to achieve a, perhaps apparent, precision, but in
the second we see a common literary device, introducing into the account direct
speech, dialogues and monologues, enlivening the dry account in the third
person. Such literary devices only demonstrate the author's erudition and the
existing literary tradition, but no more.</p>
<p>The first part of the Secret History is a genealogy of the
Mongols, something like a literary reworking of the oral tradition about the
ancestor, Bodonchar, but the second part, the youth of Chinggis until he was
first chosen in 1182, differs from both the preceding and the following parts.
In it the legendary character is lost, and it is not yet a chronicle. The author
is still writing in the third person, but in unusual detail. For example, that
the moon was shining when Temujin fled from Tayichi'ut captivity, how the horses
were distributed at the Merkit raid and so on. Had he been a witness of the
events, he would have written something in the first person, so, we should
suppose that he used a work on this subject that already existed before him, but
reworking it to agree with his plan. Rashid ad-Din confirms the existence of
such oral literature.</p>
<p>&quot;At that time there was a certain wise and penetrating
old man of the Bayaut tribe. He said: 'Seche-beki of the Kiiyat-Jurkin tribe
aspires to rule, but this is not his business. Jamuqa-sechen who continually
makes people clash with one another and engages in all <b><font COLOR="#943634">{231}
</font></b>sorts of hypocritical tricks to advance his affairs,
he too will not succeed. Jochibara, in other words Jochi-Qasar, Chinggiskhan's
brother also similarly aspires. He counts on his strength and ability to shoot
arrows, but he, too, will not succeed. Alak-Udur of the Merkit tribe, aspiring
to power and displaying a certain strength and greatness, will also not achieve
anything. But this Temujin [i.e. Chinggiskhan] possesses the external
appearance, habit and skill to be a chief and to rule, and he undoubtedly will
achieve a ruling position.' He uttered this speech, according to Mongol custom,
in rhythmical, allegorical prose.&quot;  <a name="sik4text26"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note26">[+26]</a></p>
<p>This quotation describes a genre which was fashionable in the
twelfth century. This is not an edifying or an entertaining work, but a
political programme processed in literary fashion, adapted for agitational
purposes. One can conceive that such works were used as material by the author
of the Secret History. From this he would be able to draw detailed information
on the twelfth century. But, while using various materials, the author never
departs from the single plan he has envisaged.</p>
<p>The Secret History is traditionally constructed: after a
brief introduction there is the opening section, the abduction of Ho`elun. Then
the development of the action and the dramatic situation proceeds up to the
culmination, Jamuqa's death. The device used is extremely elementary, but always
effective, literary parallelism, between Jamuqa and Temujin. Events after the
great kuriltai of 1206 are depicted with much less detail. This, strictly
speaking, is an epilogue, and the author only becomes enlivened at the end when
he makes Ogedei publicly repent of drunkenness, greed and neglect of his
military officers (the killing of Doqolqu-cherbi). The author's treatment of his
material is extremely uneven. We have already seen that he fails to describe
whole decades. But apart from this, the author describes in great detail
episodes in the civil war, certain events in Chinggiskhan's personal life
discreditable to him, but scarcely touches on the external wars and conquests
which were evidently only known to him by hearsay. All this does not harm the
work's unity, since an exposition of the history of the Mongols, it seems, was
not part of the author's task any more than glorifying Temujin's character was.
This is a &quot;Secret History&quot;, you know! The work pursued definite aims;
which ones will be seen from an <b><font COLOR="#943634">{232} </font></b>analysis
of the main characters. Yet, analysing them, we should constantly recall that
these people passed through the author's consciousness and became personages,
that the author was by no means objective and that we are now not sorting out a
period, but a literary work written many years ago and directed against someone.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Characters</h4>
<p>The main figure in the work is Temujin Chinggiskhan; however,
to reach a conclusion about his personality, character or abilities is extremely
difficult. The author's relation to the hero throughout the course of the tale
does not change; it remains ambiguous.</p>
<p>The first personality: Temujin is an evil, cowardly, stupid,
vengeful, treacherous man.</p>
<p>The second personality: Chinggiskhan is a sovereign,
far-sighted, restrained, just, generous.</p>
<p>In fact, as a personality Temujin seems antipathetic from the
first moment. His father tells his future father-in-law: &quot;My lad is
terribly frightened of dogs&quot; (ß 66); the child's unhealthy nervousness is
presented by the author as cowardice, i.e. the most shameful vice in a military
society.</p>
<p>When Charqa tells him of the withdrawal of the ulus, Temujin
weeps (ß 73). A completely human feature, a detail which might have been
omitted when speaking of a world ruler.</p>
<p>During the Tayichi'ut and Merkit raids Temujin does not take
part in organising their repulsion, and Borte, the young, beloved wife, remains
a prey to the enemy only because of her husband's feeling of panic since her
horse had been taken as a remount (egoism) (ß 99). His prayer on Burqan
mountain cannot be considered to display nobility either in content, or in
style, or in any way.</p>
<p>Temujin says: &quot; ... I, seeking safety in flight for my
heavy body, on a clumsy steed ... have climbed up Burqan [mountain]. My life,
like the life of a louse, was spat out by Burqan-qaldun. Sparing my only life,
on my one and only horse I climbed up Qaldun, dragging myself along elk fords,
making shelters from twigs. My life was defended by Burqan-qaldun like a shield,
like the life of a butterfly. I felt great terror'(ß103).</p>
<p>In fact, the danger was great, but Qasar, Belgutei, Bo'orchu,
Jelme were subject to the same risk and nevertheless behaved <b><font COLOR="#943634">{233}
</font></b>man-fully. In overemphasising Temujin's cowardice,
however, the author, without noticing it himself, lets slip that both Tayichi'ut
and Merkit caught only Temujin. We have to suppose that the author failed to
describe the qualities less pleasing to the enemy than cowardice.</p>
<p>Having depicted Temujin as a coward, the author does not halt
here. He ascribes to him a fault no less shameful in twelfth-century conditions:
lack of respect for his parents and lack of affection for his relatives.</p>
<p>Temujin, because of some childish trifling quarrel kills his
stepbrother, Bekter, coming up behind him when Bekter was not even intending to
resist. The author's attitude is expressed in Temujin's mother's words, angrily
comparing her son to wild beasts and a demon (ßß76-8).</p>
<p>The author put his feelings into the empress-mother's words,
yet undoubtedly Ho`elun could not have said these words, because the camel is
named among the animals listed. We know that in the twelfth century the Mongols
scarcely used camels, although they obtained large numbers of them in the form
of tribute after the Tangut campaign. Since literary association should always
be linked with objects known to the reader, this detail shows that the monologue
was not composed in the twelfth, but in the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>Further: when the shaman Teb-Tenggeri slanders Qasar,
Chinggiskhan immediately arrests the latter and submits him to a humiliating
interrogation which was only broken off thanks to his mother's intervention.
While outwardly giving way to her, however, Temujin does not cease to insult
Qasar and this hastens the death of his own mother (ß 244).</p>
<p>The author does not reproach Chinggis with the foul killing
of Teb-Tenggeri, but he stresses the neglect of his brother, Otchigin (ßß
245,246); finally, his uncle Daritai owes his life, but his children Jochi,
Chagatai and Ogedei owe their forgiveness only to public opinion, i.e. to the
intercession of the noyans whom the khan did not dare ignore.</p>
<p>Suspicion and malice are also noted in the episode with Qulan
when the faithful and meritorious Naya was tortured and all but lost his life
because of the unfounded and unjust suspicion of adultery with the queen (ß
197).</p>
<p>Chinggis's malice and vengefulness are specially noted by the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{234} </font></b>author
in describing the quarrels with the Jurkin clan at a feast when he fanned a
drunken brawl into a feud (ßß 130-2), and the subsequent punishment of
Buri-boko, the only true hero, shocks even the author himself, who is accustomed
to excesses, by its treachery This episode is told in a dry, restrained and
fastidious manner (ß 140)</p>
<p>Even the women, the ladies according to the Secret History,
feel a revulsion to the personality of the tale's hero After the captive Yisugen
became queen, she seeks an excuse to cede her place and palms her sister off on
her husband, her sister, reconciled with her high position willy-nilly,
continues to yearn for her bridegroom, a poor exile (ßß 155, 156), whom
Chinggis recognises and executes without any cause or accusation</p>
<p>All this may have actually happened, but it is interesting
that the author diligently collected and wrote up the scandals of the khan's
headquarters, while he omitted more important events</p>
<p>According to the Secret History, Temujin shows no talent for
military activities The counter-raid on the Merkit is an affair run by Jamuqa
and Ong-qan (ß 113), the battle at Dalan-balajut was lost, the battle at
Koyiten took a favourable turn only as a consequence of the break-up of the
anti-Chinggis confederation, the rout of the Kerait was achieved by Cha'urqan,
Dodei-cherbi (ß 193) arranged the dispositions for the rout of the Naiman and
they were carried out by Jebe, Kubilai, Jelme and Sube'etei</p>
<p>It becomes completely incomprehensible how such a man,
without gifts, malicious, vengeful, cowardly, could found a world empire from
nothing But let us look at his second personality</p>
<p>Above everything, the author is a patriot and the successes
of Mongol arms always impress him He regards the hunting down of the Merkit, the
extermination of the Tatars, the enslavement of the Kerait and Naiman as heroic
deeds, and here Chinggiskhan receives all that esteem which had been refused
Temujin After the battle at Koyiten Chinggis is shown in his best light he is
grateful to Jelme and Sorgan-shira, reasonable with regard to Jebe His
legislative measures are mainly benefits and awards to the army officers
Chinggiskhan attentively listens to the admonitions of his generals and arranges
decisions in accord with their opinions (ß 260) Yet it is easy to see that the
author's sympathies he rather with the officers rewarded than with their
benefactor In describing the army the author falls into an enthusiastic, almost
an exalted tone (ß 195).</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{235} </font></b>The author's opinion of
Chinggiskhan, the hero and leader, is completely expressed in the words:
&quot;So he established men as noyans and officers of a thousand men who
laboured together with him and together they created the state&quot; (ß 224).
The author carefully notes what favours are granted for what services, and he
does not hold back in describing the services again. In an emotional description
of the Mongol army put into the mouth of Jamuqa, first place is given to the
&quot;four dogs&quot;, Jebe and Kubilai, Jelme and Sube'etei, second to the
shock troops of Uru'ut and Mangqut, but the khan and his brothers are given
third place and the author finds words of praise for all, apart from Temujin of
whom he only says that he wears good armour.</p>
<p>Sube'etei-ba'atur is the author's favourite hero. A whole
panegyric on Sube'etei is put in the mouth of Chinggiskhan: &quot;If [the
fleeing Merkit princelings] had risen to the heavens, you, Sube'etei, would
surely have reached them, turning into a falcon, flying as on wings. If they had
turned into marmots, even burrowing into the earth with their claws, you,
Sube'etei, would surely catch them, turning into a tool, striking and searching.
If they swam away into the sea, turning into fish, you, Sube'etei, would surely
fish them out, turning into a seine and catching them&quot; (ß 199). Other
noyans are also recalled by the author, but not in such a delighted tone and
only in the general list of those rewarded, while Sube'etei is also mentioned as
the conqueror of the Russians (ß 277). In general, the author is clearly not
indifferent to the military officers and among Ogedei's four crimes there is
even listed the secret killing of Doqolqu, an ordinary officer (cherbi), but who
&quot;always went ahead of all in the eyes of his sovereign&quot; (ß 281).</p>
<p>So, we can state that the author accepts the khan in as much
as the army accepts him, but this is not all.</p>
<p>The author stresses fidelity to the &quot;natural
sovereign&quot; as a positive quality irrespective of the harm or use it brings
to the khan's affairs.</p>
<p>Chinggis executes Jamuqa's nokors who had betrayed their
prince, and Kokochu, Sengum's groom, who had abandoned his master in the desert,
and, on the other hand, rewards Naya and Qadaq-ba`atur for their fidelity to his
enemies, but their &quot;natural sovereign&quot;. Here in essence is the creed
of the soldier's fidelity to his banner and leader elevated into a religious and
ethical principle, since it only takes account of devotion in battle, but not at
all in peacetime. The author's ideology distorts in retrospect the events <b><font COLOR="#943634">{236}
</font></b>he has described. But for the moment it is important
for us to establish that the positive interpretation of Chinggiskhan is, in the
author's eyes, linked with his consistent service to his own troops, while the
negative one is linked with his personal qualities.</p>
<p>This interpretation of events is doubtful as regards
trustworthiness. We have to suppose that the matter was not quite as the author
of the Secret History depicts it for us, the more so as he himself twice lets
the cat out of the bag.</p>
<p>The first time, when Sorgan-shira and his family save Temujin
from the Tayichi'ut they submit only to the charm of his personality, and the
second time Bo'orchu abandons his father's home and follows a man unknown to him
for the same reason.</p>
<p>The author wrote these studies wanting to praise Bo'orchu and
Sorgan-shira, but in doing so, without himself noticing it, he cast a shadow on
his conception, the creation of which I ascribe to the tendentious nature of the
Secret History which has been noted more than once.</p>
<p>For a complete picture we should look at the features of
Chinggis-khan's enemies: Ong-qan and Jamuqa, his children: Jochi, Chagatai and
Ogedei and his real successor in power, the minister plenipotentiary Ye-lu
Chu-cai. No less a surprise awaits us.</p>
<p>The matter is simple as regards Ong-qan. The author clearly
does not like him, but, evidently, personal concern comes in here. When Ong-qan
routed the Merkit, &quot;from this booty he gave Chinggiskhan nothing&quot; (ß
157). Evidently, the author himself was counting on a share of the Merkit booty
and was offended that he got nothing. In order to blacken the unfortunate Kerait
petty king, the author collected scandal, of which there is usually no lack, and
twice repeated it: in a separate paragraph (ß 152) and in Chinggis's message to
the leaders of the hostile coalition (ß 177). Yet, if we collect all the
references to Ong-qan, he appears as an old man, flabby, dull and good-natured.
A sable coat was enough to purchase his favour and he paid for it by undertaking
a difficult campaign to free Borte. He replies to Jamuqa's bitter reproaches for
being late in a conciliatory tone. He equally quietly reacts to the choice of
Temujin as khan, being happy for a sympathetic person. He rebutted Jamuqa's
intrigues sensibly and quietly, but his tendency to compromise made him give way
to the influence of his entourage and caused his ruin.</p>
<p>In general, even in the author's opinion, he deserves pity,
rather <b><font COLOR="#943634">{237} </font></b>than
reproof. But, in fact, Ong-qan was the murderer of his uncles, a tyrant and
traitor. Can one believe the source?</p>
<p>Jamuqa's personality is the greatest puzzle of our source. He
appears for the first time when Borte had to be freed from Merkit captivity, but
we know that the friendship between Temujin and Jamuqa began considerably
earlier (ß 116). Jamuqa responds with alacrity to the appeal for help. The
author rousingly depicts for us the image of a knight, faithful in friendship,
intelligent, since his speech details the whole disposition of the campaign
which Ong-qan had refused to arrange, warlike and experienced. The description
of Jamuqa's equipment is particularly full and explicit. His nobility is
especially noted: Jamuqa proudly declared to Ong-qan, who was late at the
meeting-place: &quot;Both in a storm for a meeting and in rain for a gathering
one should arrive with no delay.&quot; Does a Mongol &quot;yes&quot; differ at
all from an oath? (ß 108).</p>
<p>According to the Secret History, the success of the campaign
was determined by the exact fulfilment of Jamuqa's dispositions, as is later
repeated by the author in Tekujin's expression of gratitude (ß 113).</p>
<p>The quarrel between Jamuqa and Temujin is a problem so far
not fully sorted out. Those who have investigated the problem have ascribed
decisive significance to the riddle which Jamuqa set Temujin about choosing
grazing grounds, and in this they have gone along the road towards which the
author of the Secret History has urged them. There is no doubt that the riddle
contained elements of political programmes, as there were in Borte's reply, but
not in the form that this in fact took place, but in a retrospective view of
1182 from 1240. For some reason no one has noticed that those participating in
the events, Jamuqa and Temujin, gave completely different explanations. Jamuqa
names specific people as those to blame for the break - the Mongol grandees
Altan and Quchar (ß 127) and repeats this version before his death, asserting
that &quot;our opponents incited us, the two-faced ones set us upon one another
and we parted forever&quot; (ß 201). But Temujin considers that Jamuqa himself
is to blame for the quarrel, coming to hate him out of envy (ß 179). Thus, we
see that the author of the Secret History has again let the cat out of the bag,
but his talent was sufficient to impose his version on the reader, a version
advantageous to his political tendency the content of which was to glorify
Jamuqa since &quot;in thought he <b><font COLOR="#943634">{238} </font></b>hastened
further than his <i>anda` </i>(ß 201). This assertion was essential to the
author. We shall see why later.</p>
<p>The author constructs the image of Jamuqa on the reverse
principle to that of Temujin, while the literary parallelism is maintained with
unusual precision.</p>
<p>The author evaluates all that concerns Jamuqa's personality
unusually highly, and he puts this opinion into the mouth of Temujin as the
basis for forgiving Jamuqa. But the author speaks extremely vaguely about
Jamuqa's political programme, by hints and half hints. He categorically asserts
that &quot;Jamuqa plundered the people who made him a khan&quot; (ß 144),
forgetting that even after this the greater part of the Mongols followed Jamuqa,
not Chinggis.</p>
<p>It seems that the author is trying to discredit Jamuqa's
measures which were, apparently, completely comprehensible since the conference
that had been organised broke up and the soldiers deserted. The author condemns
Jamuqa's intrigues in the Kerait headquarters, but through the mouths of the
Kerait Ong-qan and Gurin-ba'atur, i.e. his enemies. Evidently, in 1240 Jamuqa
continued to remain an odious figure for certain circles of the Mongol ruling
elite, and therefore the author is extremely careful; he does not want to
blacken Jamuqa too much, but he is frightened to whitewash him.</p>
<p>The author's attitude to Chinggiskhan's sons is sceptical, to
say the least. He does not like Jochi and eagerly retails the scandal of his
illegitimacy. In Chagatai he observes only ferocity, while the dull and
featureless Ogedei is depicted as a drunkard, a womaniser, and a miser, fencing
his hunting reserves in case the animals might escape into his brothers&quot;
lands. But Ogedei was, in truth, a weak character, and under him Ye-lu Chu-cai
dealt with everything. What does the author write about Ye-lu Chu-cai? Not a
single word! This is as strange as if a historian of Louis XIII forgot to
mention Richelieu.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Right to Doubt</h4>
<p>So we see that our analysis has disclosed a number of puzzles
in the source which we had not at first noticed. The key to solving them is one
and the same: the author's political bias. This explains both the chronological
omissions, and the slips of the tongue, and the dual attitude to the great
ghosts, and his increased interest in internal, rather than external history.
The only thing unclear is who the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{239}
</font></b>author, with his patriotic and monarchical attitude,
was struggling with and engaging in polemic against.</p>
<p>But then our basic and most complete source is not a heroic
epic,  <a name="sik4text27"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note27">[+27]</a> since it is a poem without a hero, is not a historical treatise,  <a name="sik4text28"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note28">[+28]</a>
since it lacks a chronological sequence, and not an &quot;anthology&quot;,  <a name="sik4text29"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note29">[+29]</a>
because the principle in selecting facts is antididactic. It seems we have
before us a thirteenth-century political lampoon.</p>
<p>The aim of the work was to present the reader in 1240 with
Mongol history from a particular point of view and to inculcate in him a
particular political conception. Therefore, the title of the &quot;Secret
History&quot; has to be recognised as the more apt, just as with the <i>Historia
arcana </i>of Procopius of Caesarea. The title of &quot;Concealed Tale&quot; has
a somewhat different shade of meaning, a folklore flavour, which I believe is
less appropriate.</p>
<p>To understand the bias of the Secret History it is essential
to investigate the time when it was created, i.e. 1240, and the relationships of
the political groupings, to one of which the author of the <i>Yuan-chao-bi-shi </i>adhered.
As for the time that concerns us, the period when Chinggiskhan rose to the
throne, accepting a tendentious treatment of events will lead the researcher
astray from his analysis, for a talented writer is always able to foist his
conception on the trustful reader.</p>
<p>So, for this reason we should doubt the commonly held
understanding of Chinggiskhan's ascent to the throne as the consolidation of the
Mongol tribes and feudal lords under the authority of a gifted military leader.
Were the matter so simple, there would have been no need for chronological
omissions, but both versions, the &quot;official&quot; and the
&quot;secret&quot;, are equally guilty of them. There would not have been such a
great discrepancy in describing events, sometimes diametrically opposing them;
but, on the other hand, there would have been an explanation of the astonishing
fact that a small, poor people conquered the world in half a century. It seems
the sources did not intend to tell the truth, and historians, trusting them,
have constructed a &quot;false history of the Mongols&quot;. I believe this
negative conclusion to be very important.</p>
<p>The investigation we have made shows that evaluation and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{240}
</font></b>sociological analysis of the period when Chinggiskhan
was raised to eminence are only possible after confirming the evidence in the
sources by a strict historical criticism, both internal and comparative. We can
only establish which of the Mongol knights was struggling to establish feudal
relations and which was against when the motives for their actions have been
disclosed; but it is these which have been carefully concealed by the authors of
the sources. The widespread method of argument by means of quotations will lead
us astray onto the false track suggested by the tendency concealed in our
source. Moreover, given the disagreements we have noted in the description of
events, quotations can always be selected to support contrary views. It is for
this reason that scholarly arguments on these subjects have hitherto not
produced results.</p>
<p>Those concerned with Mongolian language and literature should
decide the problem of the reliability of the evidence in the <i>Yuan-chao-bi-shi.
</i>Yet since S. A. Kozin's translation appeared, this problem has not even been
posed. All the disputes about the wonderful source made available to scholars
have been restricted to details of the translation, with no relevance to the
sense of the work, which has remained hidden. Historians of surrounding
countries have touched on the problem of Chinggis to the extent that it impinged
on their subjects.  <a name="sik4text30"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note30">[+30]</a> That is why I, a historian of Middle Asia, have had to
engage in study of the sources to establish their reliability not from the point
of view of a language and literature specialist, but purely historically.</p>
<p>The logic of events is the only reliable starting point for
generalisation, once their sequence and inter-relation have been established.
Only in that way can the prejudiced viewpoints of the thirteenth-century
authors, which have hitherto provided a fertile soil for fruitless polemics
about the causes and significance of the events they described, be excluded.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>On whose side was the author of the Secret History lying or,
put another way, for whom did he expend his talent and energy? We have only one
thread, one chronology; but this is Ariadne's thread. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{241}
</font></b>The work was written in 1240 against the background of
a conflict between four unformed parties: the old Mongol military, the Mongol
peace, the bureaucratic Chinese-loving and the warlike Nestorian. Which party
did our author belong to?</p>
<p>We can immediately exclude the last. The author is not a
Nestorian. In his entire composition there is only one mention of Kerait
Christianity, and that ironical, in the speeches of one of prince Senggum's
friends: &quot;All of us, secretly soliciting the son, bring prayers and
incense, we repeat <i>Abai-Babai, </i>offering up prayers&quot; (ß 174) <i>(Abai-Babai
</i>means Our father). And nowhere else did our author condescend to pay
attention to another faith, while he talks a great deal about his own. This is,
perhaps, a most difficult question, but for the rest the &quot;creative&quot;
talents of the Secret History's author are clear.</p>
<p>Our author's military sympathies, already noted, and his not
mentioning the name of Ye-lu Chu-cai, make it possible for us to determine his
political attitude with complete confidence.</p>
<p>The description of Guyuk is strongly hostile: he &quot;did
not leave men even their back parts whole&quot; and &quot;skinned the
soldiers&quot; faces&quot;, &quot;in conquering the Russians and Kipchak he not
only took not a single Russian or Kipchak, but did not even get a goat's hoof (ß
277).</p>
<p>At the same time, the description of Temuge-otchigin is
always positive: &quot;Otchigin is a lad of his mother Ho`elun, he is famed as a
dare-devil. He is not late because of the weather, he will not lag behind
because of a halt&quot; (ß 195). In the squalid history of Teb-Tenggeri's
killing the author does not try to protect Temujin, but Otchigin. He stresses
that Otchigin was always the favourite of the highly esteemed Ho`oelun-eke.</p>
<p>There is enough of this to persuade us that the author of the
Secret History belonged to the &quot;old Mongol party&quot;. This is why he
whitewashes Jamuqa who is for him the bearer of ancient Mongol prowess and of
traditions going back into the past. This is why he defends him from the
accusation that he betrayed the Mongol cause, from the mouth of Chinggiskhan
himself, allegedly proposing that he should &quot;be the second shaft&quot; in
the cart of the state, his friend and adviser (ß 200). It is for this reason
that he praises Jamuqa's treachery towards the Kerait and Naiman whose
descendants in 1240 united around Guyuk, hated and despised by the author. And
it is not by accident that he says, through the mouth of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{242}
</font></b>Jamuqa, that &quot;in thought he hastened further than
his <i>anda&quot;, </i>remained a complete orphan with one wife, a &quot;reciter
of old tales&quot; .  <a name="sik4text31"></a><a href="sik4a.htm#sik4note31">[+31]</a> But this is not true! Jamuqa's friends and companions
at this time had not yet laid down their arms. The manly Merkit and the
unconquerable Naiman prince Kuchlug held out till 1218, and Jamuqa became
captive by chance, through the treachery of his soldiers. But what is this to
the author of the Secret History? He has to glorify ancient Mongol prowess and
depict the Kerait arid Naiman as carefree, effete boasters, almost cowards
except for certain heroes like Qadaq-ba'atur (ßß 185,189,195,196) who was
treated kindly for his prowess by Chinggiskhan himself (ß 185). Therefore, he
hushes up the part played by Elchidei-noyan in the execution of Jamuqa, for he
would have had to note that this friend of Guyuk was also a favourite of
Chinggiskhan, and then the conception created in the Secret History would have
lost its political effectiveness. Elchidei is only mentioned in the Secret
History in connection with the fact that once, passing a guard, he was detained,
and it was twice pointed out that this was right (ßß 229, 278).</p>
<p>A return to the old prowess, that is the ideal of the author
and the political platform for which he wrote his wonderfully talented work.</p>
<p>In 1240 he was, it seems, very old, because in 1182 the
pronoun &quot;we&quot; replaces &quot;they&quot;. If the author had been only 16
or 18 at that time, in 1240 he would be getting on for 80. For this reason alone
we can say that the Secret History could not be his only work. But time and age
have hidden the others from us. Not only are his grandiose erudition and free
treatment of quotations, as well as the change of tone in the course of the
narrative thus understandable, but also the title itself. This is truly a Secret
History, a protest against the official tradition idealising Chinggiskhan's
personality.</p>
<p>The author set himself the task of showing that it was not
the khan, but the valiant Mongol troops who created the empire. The khan may
make mistakes, may have faults, but he should esteem and care for his veterans
&quot;who laboured together with him and together they created the state&quot; (ß
224).</p>
<p>The lampoon was written when literati were, with the khan's
favour, pushing out the veterans. The lampoon was intended to be <b><font COLOR="#943634">{243}
</font></b>propaganda among these offended officers, he showed
them that it was they who were the salt of the earth and it was to them that the
empire owed its existence. Of course, this was a Secret History, since the
Mongol government would never have allowed open propaganda for such views.</p>
<p>We can say nothing about the further fate of the author of
the Secret History, but it involuntarily strikes us that he was among those
noyans who incited Otchigin to the coup of 1242 and who paid with their heads
for the lack of talent and cowardliness of their wellborn leader.</p>
