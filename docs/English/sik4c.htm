<h4>The Harmfulness of Prejudice</h4>
<p>Preconceived opinions which, once expressed as hypotheses,
are then accepted as incontrovertible truths are one of the most fatal mistakes
for academic thought. The force of their established nature paralyses criticism
and the false opinion takes root, distorting the picture of the historical
process. Among such opinions is the concept of Mongol religion of the twelfth to
thirteenth centuries as primitive paganism. It is held that the Mongols esteemed
all faiths equally, supposing that it was only important to pray for the khan,
that they protected all clergy, since intolerance did not follow from their
religion. The error in this opinion is that the particular is arbitrarily taken
as the general and that the causes of the very relative Mongol tolerance are
transferred from earth to heaven, i.e. the causes are sought in their outlook,
not in the existing political situation.</p>
<p>Now, after critically investigating an authentic source, the
Secret History of the Mongols, we shall make so bold as to assert that Mongol
twelfth- to thirteenth-century religion was a completely conceived world view
with a tradition going back to deep antiquity and was no less finely honed than
Buddhism and Islam, Zoroastrianism and Manichaeism, Catholicism and Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>Let us begin our inquiry with a polemic.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The &quot;Black Faith'</h4>
<p>The most detailed description of ancient Mongol religion has
been given by the Buryat scholar Dordzhi Banzarov  <a name="sik4text59"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note59">[+59]</a> who expounded the views of
the nineteenth-century Buryat pagans. He supplied his <b><font COLOR="#943634">{262}
</font></b>work with a great number of brilliant historical
digressions and concluded that: &quot;the so called shamanist religion, at least
among the Mongols, cannot have come from Buddhism or any other faith&quot;.  <a name="sik4text60"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note60">[+60]</a>
In his opinion, the &quot;Black Faith of the Mongols derived from the same
source as many ancient religious systems; the external world is nature, the
internal world is the spirit of man and the phenomena of both were the source of
the Black Faith&quot;.</p>
<p>According to Banzarov's description, the Black Faith
consisted of worshipping the heaven, earth, fire, the secondary gods - tengri,
and the ongon, the souls of the dead. The part played by the shaman, according
to Banzarov, is that he &quot;is a priest, doctor and wizard or
soothsayer&quot;.  <a name="sik4text61"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note61">[+61]</a> As a priest he makes sacrifices on festivals and for other
reasons; as a doctor he summons the spirit of the tormented patient and accepts
it into his own body; the part he plays as a soothsayer is clear. It may be
assumed that the Buryat of Banzarov's day actually professed such a system. But
was it so in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries?</p>
<p>Mongol thirteenth-century religion appears differently in N.
Veselovskii's research work based on written sources. Despite his listing almost
the entire literature on Mongol beliefs on his/ first page, Veselovskii
insistently calls the Tatar religion shamanism, understanding by this an
eclectic combination of all sorts of concepts.</p>
<p>In the first place Veselovskii sets fire worship, considering
this phenomenon characteristic of all primitive religions (?!); in the second,
he sets worship of the sun and the moon  <a name="sik4text62"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note62">[+62]</a> (Banzarov says nothing of this
cult). There follows worship of the bush &quot;the meaning of which we cannot
now guess&quot;,  <a name="sik4text63"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note63">[+63]</a> and worship of idols which Veselovskii equates with the
ongon - the ancestor spirits, although he also calls the ongon &quot;the
guardian of happiness and the herds, the protector of trapping&quot; etc.  <a name="sik4text64"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note64">[+64]</a>
Contradiction does not confuse our author.</p>
<p>The end of the work is devoted to the question of Tatar
tolerance which allegedly flows from their religious concepts. Now, though, we
must establish that Veselovskii gives a completely different picture than
Banzarov, but at the same time makes the same mistake, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{263}
</font></b>mixing into a single whole the cult of nature, magic,
omens and ecstatic manipulation by the shaman mediums. Like Banzarov, he accepts
a historically compounded syncretism for the dogma of a positive religion.</p>
<p>Let us return to Banzarov. A series of questions immediately
arise when we read his book attentively. First, with which spirits do the
shamans deal: the spirits of the dead, i.e. the ongon, or the spirits of nature,
of the earth, the etugen, from which the female shamans take their name, idogan?
Second, what is the relation between the shaman spirits and the chief god, the
Heaven? Third, why do the shamans not worship the chief god, and even ignore
him? Fourth, Banzarov writes that &quot;Heaven&quot; must not be considered
identical with God,  <a name="sik4text65"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note65">[+65]</a> since the Mongols conceived Heaven as ruler of the
world, eternal justice and the source of life; but what then is God? Fifth, why
does Banzarov earnestly and tendentiously try to represent Heaven as an
impersonal principle, although the facts he later adduces from
thirteenth-century sources contradict this? Sixth, on what basis does Banzarov
derive the fire cult from Zoro-astrian Persia, despite his primary assertion
about the autochthonous nature of shamanism?</p>
<p>True to his preconceived opinion about the autochthonous
nature of the &quot;Black Faith&quot;, Banzarov mixes into one the religious
concepts of third-century B.C. Hun, sixth-century Turks, thirteenth-century
Mongols and nineteenth-century Buryat. Naturally, it is impossible to bind these
different cults into a single system.  <a name="sik4text66"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note66">[+66]</a></p>
<p>Thus, we can state that both works fail to satisfy us, mainly
from the point of view of method. In reviewing religions historically it is not
the psychological bases of their religiosity that is important, but the symbol
of the faith or the answer to the question: &quot;In what God do you
believe?&quot;, i.e. the principle of historical and cultural classification.</p>
<p>The historian is interested not in understanding the
consciousness of the ordinary believer, where usually many religions are
interwoven in the most fantastic patterns, but in the principles of religions
which have taken shape and developed, since studying them in their pure form and
elements will allow us to establish actual cultural links and explain hitherto
incomprehensible historical phenomena. So, studying religion is not an end in
itself, but an <b><font COLOR="#943634">{264} </font></b>auxiliary
historical discipline. Therefore, leaving aside questions of the origin of
religion, the part it plays in consciousness and so on, we shall regard
individual religions as facts of the historical process. We shall try to strip
away the syncretic layers from the basic views characteristic of particular
religions and shall attempt to find the guiding principles for the dogma of the
thirteenth-century Mongols.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Mongol God and His Character</h4>
<p>One may find valuable information on the ancient religion of
the Mongols in William of Rubruck, the Minorite monk who journeyed to Mongke-khan
and was extremely concerned with religious questions. He undertook his journey
that he might be convinced that Batu's son, Sartak, was really a Christian, as
Black Sea merchants had told him. So it turned out, but it is curious that
Sartak's secretary, Koiyak, after forbidding Rubruck to tell Batu that Sartak
was a Christian, said: &quot;He is not a Christian, but a Moal.&quot;  <a name="sik4text67"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note67">[+67]</a>
Rubruck was troubled that the Tatars confused religions and nations, but we must
suppose that Koiyak, himself a Nestorian, understood what he said. When Rubruck
reached Mongke-khan, he managed to take part in a religious disputation in which
Muslim and Christians united on a platform of monotheism in a polemic against
the Buddhists. Then Mongke-khan, too, expressed his point of view. He said:
&quot;We, Mongols, believe in a Single God who is in heaven, we learn his will
through prophets&quot;.  <a name="sik4text68"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note68">[+68]</a> This was the creed of the Mongol faith briefly noted
by Rubruck. Evidently, this was what Koiyak had in mind, counterposing the
Mongols to the Christians; and it is undoubted that this doctrine differs
considerably from the polytheism described by Banzarov. But can we,
nevertheless, consider it monotheism?</p>
<p>In a chapter on worship among the Tatars, Piano Carpini says:
&quot;They believe in One God whom they recognise as the creator of all that is
visible and invisible, but they also recognise him as the creator both of
blessings in this world, and also of torments, yet they do not honour him with
prayers or praise, or any ritual.&quot;  <a name="sik4text69"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note69">[+69]</a> Apart from that, they piously
worship the sun, moon and fire, as well as <b><font COLOR="#943634">{265}
</font></b>water and earth, devoting to them the first of their
food and drink, mainly in the morning, before they begin to eat or drink.  <a name="sik4text70"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note70">[+70]</a></p>
<p>Piano Carpini, although not guilty of a conscious lie,
demands some attention. During his mad journey on post-horses to Guyuk's
headquarters and back, going short of food and not knowing the language, it
would be difficult to make exhaustive observations. Therefore, he is not guilty
because he understood the worship of the Heaven as adoration of the heavenly
bodies and arbitrarily added the cult of water to that of the earth. For the
rest, he agrees with Hetoum the Armenian in telling us that the Tatars
&quot;know one eternal God and call upon his name, but that is all. They do not
pray and do not refrain from sin for fear of God&quot;.  <a name="sik4text71"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note71">[+71]</a></p>
<p>Rashid ad-Din speaks no less defiantly about their monotheist
worship. He adduces a series of Chinggiskhan's utterances on this question. In
conversation with his sons he said &quot;... by the strength of the Lord and
with the help of heaven I have conquered a kingdom for you&quot;.  <a name="sik4text72"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note72">[+72]</a> Giving an
instruction to Jebe and Sube'etei, Chinggis-khan said: &quot;By the strength of
the great God, until you seize him [Muhammed] do not return&quot;.  <a name="sik4text73"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note73">[+73]</a>
Chinggiskhan said of himself that &quot;his affairs grow from day to day like
the new moon; god's help descends from Heaven by the strength of the all-highest
lord, and prosperity has come on earth by his help&quot;.  <a name="sik4text74"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note74">[+74]</a> Finally, the text
of Chinggiskhan's prayer, when he prayed on top of a hillock, hanging his belt
on his neck, after undoing his cloak and falling on his knees, has been
preserved: &quot;O eternal lord, you know and are aware that Altan-khan began
the enmity ... I am seeking for the blood of retribution and vengeance. If you
know that this retribution is mine of right, send me down from above strength
and triumph and command angels, people, <i>peris </i>and wonders to help
me.&quot;  <a name="sik4text75"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note75">[+75]</a> These words might seem to be a traditional Muslim appeal to Allah,
but Allah's <b><font COLOR="#943634">{266} </font></b>name
is nowhere mentioned and the Persian word &quot;huda&quot;, i.e. &quot;God&quot;
occurs everywhere.</p>
<p>But we take the most valuable information on the Mongols
having a cult of a single supreme god from the Concealed Tale. There this god is
called the Eternal Heaven. The Mongols distinguished the material
&quot;blue&quot; heaven from the spiritual &quot;eternal&quot; heaven.  <a name="sik4text76"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note76">[+76]</a> The
&quot;Eternal Heaven&quot;, according to Banzarov as we have seen, was not a
personal god, but only the world order.</p>
<p>Chinggiskhan's words quoted above, however, convince us of
the contrary. A series of Chinggiskhan's utterances could be added in which the
Eternal Heaven stands forth as the bearer of help. Thus, turning to his sons, he
says: &quot;The Eternal Heaven will multiply your strength and might and will
deliver Togtai's sons into your hands&quot;.  <a name="sik4text77"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note77">[+77]</a> And further: &quot;When with
the help of the Eternal Heaven we shall transform our state of all the
peoples...&quot;  <a name="sik4text78"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note78">[+78]</a></p>
<p>According to Chinggiskhan's words, the Eternal Heaven demands
not only prayers, but also activity: &quot; ... you, Jurchedai, struck the
enemy. You threw down all: the Jurkin, Tubegen, Dongqayit and the thousand
select guards of Qori-Shiremun. When you moved forward to the main middle
regiment, with your terrible arrow you wounded the ruddy Senggum in the cheek.
That is why the Eternal heaven opened the doors and the way to us.&quot;  <a name="sik4text79"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note79">[+79]</a></p>
<p>As we see, the Eternal Heaven is a god who not only gives
help, but demands activity from his worshippers, i.e. is more active than the
Calvinist God who saves by faith without deeds.</p>
<p>On the basis of what has been said, it seems we should
recognise that the Mongols had a cult of a single, almighty and active god. But
the matter is far from being as simple as that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Two in One or Dualism?</h4>
<p>The Concealed Tale tells us quite definitely that Tengri was
not the only god of the Mongols. Earth - Etugen - is mentioned along with
Heaven. For example: &quot;Temujin said: we ... have increased in strength by
the Heaven and the Earth, called the mighty Tenggeri, and have been supplied by
mother Earth&quot;;  <a name="sik4text80"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note80">[+80]</a> further: &quot;In the Kerait <b><font COLOR="#943634">{267}
</font></b>campaign we, accepting an increase in strength from
the Heaven and the Earth, crushed and captured the Kerait people&quot;.  <a name="sik4text81"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note81">[+81]</a></p>
<p>Here is a clear dualism, but we have to suppose that the
Heaven was worshipped more than the Earth, since the Heaven is continually
mentioned without the Earth, while the Earth is never mentioned without the
Heaven.</p>
<p>Piano Carpini tells us that the Tatars question the god Itoga
whom the Cuman (Turks) call Kam through enchanters.  <a name="sik4text82"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note82">[+82]</a> Itoga, according to
Banzarov's absolutely correct guess, is undoubtedly the Mongol Etugen, and Kam
is shaman. According to Piano Carpini, the Mongols feared this deity and made
sacrifices to him. <i>Obo </i>(heaps of stones at crossings) were constructed
for Etugen; moreover, in antiquity bloody sacrifices were made at <i>obo. </i> <a name="sik4text83"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note83">[+83]</a></p>
<p>Marco Polo speaks no less definitely of the Mongols&quot; two
gods: &quot;They [?] say that there is a supreme heavenly God; they daily burn
incense for him and beseech him for good understanding and health. They have a
god, they call him Nagitai and say that that is the god of the earth, he guards
their sons, their livestock and their grain.&quot;  <a name="sik4text84"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note84">[+84]</a> In another place the same
Marco Polo tells us: &quot;Each of them, high on the wall, has a tablet on which
is inscribed the name signifying the All-Highest Heavenly God. They worship it,
censing it with incense, raise up their hands and bow to the earth so that God
should give them a right mind and good health, but they ask nothing else. Below,
on the ground, stands an image which is called Natigai; the god of earthly
things which are born throughout the earth. A wife and children are given to him
and he is also worshipped. He is asked for good weather, the fruits of the
earth, sons etc.&quot;  <a name="sik4text85"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note85">[+85]</a></p>
<p>Thus, very reliable material contradicts what is equally
reliable. How are we to reconcile the principle of monotheism proclaimed by
Mongke-khan with that of dualism established in the Concealed Tale and Marco
Polo? It seems that here is a tangle not to be sorted out. But if we again pose
the basic question: &quot;In what God do you believe?&quot;, we shall receive an
unexpected answer: the Mongols believed in a god named Qormusda.</p>
<p>The coincidence in the names of the Mongol and Iranian gods
has <b><font COLOR="#943634">{268} </font></b>already
attracted the attention of historians and ethnographers. Schmidt acknowledges
that this coincidence is not chance.  <a name="sik4text86"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note86">[+86]</a> Rattsel` also focuses his attention on
it.  <a name="sik4text87"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note87">[+87]</a> The term Qormusda is widely known. Hue uses it in describing
Chinggiskhan's coronation.  <a name="sik4text88"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note88">[+88]</a> It is found in the dictionaries of Golstunskii
and Kovalevskii and is mentioned by Banzarov and Riochet.  <a name="sik4text89"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note89">[+89]</a></p>
<p>Banzarov does not doubt that Qormusda and Heaven are one and
the same. Chinggiskhan is sometimes called the Son of Heaven, sometimes the Son
of Qormusda, sometimes in Chinese Tian-zi [i.e. Son of Heaven, or Emperor -
trans.]. Buddhists translating Sanskrit and Tibetan books into Mongolian called
Indra Qormusda, and this indicates that this term had taken root in Mongolia by
the time Buddhist propaganda began there.</p>
<p>Had the term Qormusda been taken to Mongolia not from Persia,
but from India along with Buddhism, this name would have corresponded to the
Varuna of Indo-Iranian mythology. Here even Banzarov concedes the obvious and,
despite his own declaration about the autochthonous nature of the Black Faith,
notes: &quot;On close acquaintance with Mongol shamanism one finds in it,
perhaps, much in common with the teaching of Zoroaster.&quot;  <a name="sik4text90"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note90">[+90]</a> But if this is
even partly so, then the interpretation of Tenggeri - the Eternal Heaven as an
impersonal world order first of all falls away. Even before this it contradicted
the facts, but now it can be totally discounted.</p>
<p>Then the cult of the sun and moon noted by archimandrite
Palladius is explained. Temujin prayed with his face to the sun on mount Burqan.
 <a name="sik4text91"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note91">[+91]</a> But Veselovskii, arguing against this, considers that here it was not a
question of the sun, but of the south to which it seems the Mongols would turn
in performing religious rituals. As proof he adduces the fact, taken from the <i>Yuan-shi,
</i>for 1210: &quot;Chinggis, learning of the accession of Yang-zi in China,
said: &quot;this weak-minded man cannot rule&quot;, and he spat to the south
[i.e. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{269} </font></b>towards
China]&quot;.  <a name="sik4text92"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note92">[+92]</a> I cannot see this as a religious act; and if this is so, the
objection about worshipping towards the sun is lost. The fact is that the
sun-cult hypothesis is unclear and does not tie in with anything unless we
suppose that worshipping the sun was a <i>detail </i>of the cult, not a separate
cult. The sun, ancient Mithras, was the person of the Eternal Heaven, Qormusda,
and the apparent contradiction is resolved. As for the moon, it is not mentioned
among the cult objects of the Mongols. I imagine that literate foreigners, not
being very observant, included it in the Mongol pantheon simply to accompany the
sun. But where is Ahriman here?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Many Faces of The Devil</h4>
<p>Before proceeding further, let us note two exceedingly
important points:</p>
<p>(1) different things are considered evil in different
religions, though there are also sometimes coincidences; for example, the devil
in Christianity and Islam is the same; this however is not a rule, but an
exception easily explained by the fact that Muhammed picked up ready made and
generally accepted Christian ethics, which did not contradict the original
features of his teaching, as a weapon;</p>
<p>(2) the identification of the concept of evil with particular
unpleasantness is no more than a narrow-minded opinion, foreign to all developed
metaphysical conceptions, including religions.</p>
<p>Ontological evil is never equated with subjective failures,
because the formulation of this concept is based on a particular interpretation
of the cosmos. Thus, in Zoroastrianism, Ahriman is the rival of Ormuzd, lord of
the half-world, and sharing equal rights with him; in Manichaeism evil is matter
in any form; in Buddhism evil is passion moving man to activity, and good is
complete tranquillity and lack of passion; in early Christianity Satan is a
person, &quot;father of lies and killer of men&quot;, but later he became a
rebellious angel, a mutineer, a criminal, i.e. as distinct from the dualist
systems, the devil in Christianity is not primordial. Moreover, there are many
systems where in general the concept of metaphysical evil is lacking, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{270}
</font></b>both personal and cosmic. Here the concept
&quot;evil&quot; coincides with &quot;bad&quot;, which is understood as a
deviation from the law or tribal custom. Such are many genotheistic cults, and
shamanism in which a finely thought out nature philosophy replaces religion: the
teaching of the &quot;three worlds&quot; and the shaman's &quot;tree&quot; which
runs through them. The shaman climbs this so as to reach the upper and lower
worlds in his ecstasy.</p>
<p>In every language - more precisely, in every system of
semantic signals - there are conventional expressions, metaphors, which it is
senseless to translate literally. For example, &quot;square root&quot; does not
indicate a plant root as long as it is wide. That is exactly how the matter
stands with the shaman's tree. This is not an object, but an image which,
depending on context, might be translated into our philosophical language as a
means of making the transcendental immanent, a sort of intuition. And the upper
and lower worlds? They too appear in our nature philosophy under the names of
macroworld and microworld, while we ourselves are found in the mesoworld, the
middle world. Of course, it is impossible to equate shamanist philosophy and
modern physics, but it is still less correct to equate shamanism with theist
religions including the concept of a deity. Shamanism as a system for perceiving
the world is mystical through and through, but it has no place for either god or
devil.</p>
<p>But can we consider shamanism a religion? Yes, and no,
depending on how we define the term. The straightforward meaning of the word
&quot;religion&quot; is a link (with a deity, understood), from the Latin verb <i>religo</i>,
I bind, tie. Consequently, if there is no deity in the conception, then there
cannot be any link and such systems must not be called religions. On the other
hand, the variety of atheist conceptions are just as great as the theist ones.
Taoism, Buddhism, Confucianism, Jainism, like shamanism, possess all the
qualities of religious doctrines, except for recognising the existence of God.
And they all differ more from the atheism of the materialists than from the
religious systems. What are we to call them?</p>
<p>And the theist systems themselves? The clan cults in the
ancient East and in Hellas have very little in common with the world religions:
Christianity, Islam, and theistic lamaism. From the point of view of medieval
theologians, paganism was not a religion, but a collection of superstitions.
Indeed, the attitude of the pagans to the idol, now fed with sacrifices, now
beaten with whips, is quite unlike faith in Allah or in Adi-Buddha (the
Primordial Buddha, creator of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{271} </font></b>the
world). If we use the term religion everywhere, we involuntarily unite under
this concept a multiplicity of dissimilar things of different types.</p>
<p>Therefore, exclusively for convenience in using the term, I
shall call only theistic systems religions in this work, but for the whole
totality of conceptions and views of the world I shall use a broad term,
&quot;faiths&quot;, since it is so widespread and understandable without
additional explanation.</p>
<p>This lengthy and boring excursus was necessary only to
delimit the ancient Mongol religion from shamanism. They were neighbours,
co-existed and interacted, but in the ancient Mongol religion there was what
there could not be in shamanism: a cosmic evil principle.</p>
<p>Banzarov supposes that the Ahriman of the Mongol pantheon was
Erlig-qan, god of the underworld.  <a name="sik4text93"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note93">[+93]</a> I cannot agree with such a comparison,
although in fact in modern Buryat mythology Erlig-qan is the antithesis of
Qormusda. The point is that Erlig is an evil deity of the Altai shamanists from
whom, we must suppose, he reached the Buryat at a later period. The sources give
us another name: this is Piano Carpini's Itoga, the Concealed Tale's Etugen or
the Earth, Marco Polo's Natigai. Although this at first sounds paradoxical,
detailed study of the question shows that this is really so, although this, too,
is not Ahriman.</p>
<p>First of all we have to remember that in the Concealed Tale
the Earth is sometimes mentioned along with the Heaven, or is left out, but it
never appears independently. Second, according to Piano Carpini's words the
Mongols feared the god Itoga, i.e. Etugen, and made sacrifices to him, even
including blood sacrifices. The &quot;spirits of the earth and the waters&quot;
were the cause of Ogedei-khan's illness. Natigai is beseeched for earthly
blessings which itself counterposes him to the heavenly God. Among these
blessings children occupy the first place. This place answers to the conceptions
of modern Buryat according to which Qormusda is chief of fifty-five western
(good) tengri, and Erlig-qan is head of forty-four eastern (evil) ones, also
called dzayan (jayagan), spirits of the earth who summon fertility.</p>
<p>It is curious that the mountain Tadjiks` and Yagnobs` Albast
is <b><font COLOR="#943634">{272} </font></b>not
only an evil spirit, but is also the spirit without whose presence birth cannot
take place. One more not-fortuitous analogy.</p>
<p>The religious beliefs of the Buryat described by Banzarov are
undoubtedly a transformation of a more ancient religion. Erlig-qan came to them
from an Altai cult where he was head of the underworld, not an enemy of the good
god Ulgen, but his brother and helper. When people fail to make sacrifices to
Ulgen, out of his goodness he cannot punish them and he complains to Erlig. He
quickly sends a plague or some other trouble on the people, and then they have
to sacrifice to both deities, for they are at one. Erlig-qan has no similarity
to Ahriman.</p>
<p>Perhaps, here we are much closer not to an Iranian, but to an
ancient Turkish popular religion where Earth and Heaven are taken as two sides
of a single principle, not fighting, but complementing one another. This
conception goes back to deep antiquity, to the start of our period, i.e. to the
Xianbi cultural element.  <a name="sik4text94"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note94">[+94]</a> However, in the course of a thousand years an
inevitable transformation and absorption of foreign ideas took place. Evidently,
the Iranian influence which penetrated Mongolia through the Manichaes in the
eighth to ninth centuries had no influence on the essence of the views held by
the Mongols` ancestors, though they did take over the Iranian terminology. They
understood the evil principle not as half of the world order - Ahriman - but as
its unnatural violation, a lie, a betrayal. This does not, of course, mean that
the Mongols were always truthful. Who is without sin? But as an ethical category
the condemnation of betrayal is a moral imperative.</p>
<p>The author of the Secret History condemns even Chinggiskhan
for the treacherous murder of his step-brother Bekter and the hero Buri-boko,
and praises him for executing Jamuqa's nokors, but the bloody executions of the
conquered Tatars and Merkit leave him unmoved. This point of view is entirely
logical. Death in wartime is only a law of nature, but the murder of someone who
trusts you is an insult to nature and consequently to the deity. People
participating in betrayal should not live and produce descendants, for the
Mongols recognised collective responsibility and the existence of inherited
features (we would say of a gene stock). Therefore, the Tatars suffered for
handing over to his death at the hands of the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{273}
</font></b>Jurchen the Kerait khan and for poisoning
Yisugei-ba'atur. This was right according to Mongol logic.</p>
<p>We must note that this point of view was unusual for the
majority of peoples in the twelfth to thirteenth centuries. The Chinese, Muslim
Turks and even the Europeans murdered emissaries and envoys. According to Mongol
teaching, in doing this they committed the gravest sin; that was why the Mongols
dealt so harshly with Song China, with the Khwarizmshah Muhammed, with the
Russian princes on the Kalka and the Hungarians on the Shayava. But the Chinese,
Iranians, Russians and Hungarians who survived the slaughter were long unable to
understand the link between the killing of the Mongol emissaries and the
subsequent extermination of their fellow-countrymen. It seemed to them one thing
when they were killing, but another when they were the victims. Therefore, they
considered the Mongols monsters, forgetting that every consequence has a cause.
Only the most intelligent Europeans, for example, Piano Carpini and Aleksandr
Nevskii understood this. Piano Carpini tried not to have emissaries sent with
him to Europe, since he feared the Germans would kill them, but &quot;the Tatars
have the custom of never concluding peace with those people who kill their
emissaries&quot;.  <a name="sik4text95"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note95">[+95]</a> In 1259 Alexsandr Nevskii, knowing this custom, did not
allow the people of Novgorod to slaughter the Tatar emissaries and set an armed
guard on the house where they stayed. In this way he saved both the Tatars and
Novgorod. And how unlike this is to the indifference of these Novgorod people to
someone else's death! When Yaroslav slaughtered their envoys and, thereupon,
learning of the death of his father, Vladimir the Bright sun, and of the murder
of his brothers Boris and Gleb by Svyatopolk the Accursed, wanted to flee to
Sweden, the men of Novgorod, sensing gains, said to him: &quot;We cannot raise
the dead&quot; and, forgetting about betrayal, set off to put him on the throne
of Kiev.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Search for a Source of Faith</h4>
<p>So, the Mongols` evil principle is unlike the
Zoroastrians&quot; Ahriman and the Manichaes` spirit of darkness, and it differs
from the Christian conception of Satan by being impersonal. As we have noted
undoubted reminders of Iranian culture, let us turn to a third <b><font COLOR="#943634">{274}
</font></b>Iranian conception - Mithraism - which held on in Iran
until the Arab conquest. This cult underwent a long evolution, but we shall only
describe the basic trend of its historical fate.</p>
<p>Mithraism, arising among nomad tribes in the valleys of
Central Asia, was accepted by such tribes occupying Shanshun, a land in
north-west Tibet. Sedentary Tibetans inhabiting the valley of the Brahmaputra,
called the Tsan-pu in Tibet, took this faith from the Shanshun people. Here it
became the official religion with a cult, clergy, creed and an influence in
state affairs.  <a name="sik4text96"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note96">[+96]</a> The Tibetan name of this religion is Bon. From Tibet Bon
spread into east Central Asia and, after withstanding a fierce struggle with the
Buddhists, preserved its position in Tibet till the twentieth century. We have
established the identity of Mithraism and Bon in a specialised work,  <a name="sik4text97"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note97">[+97]</a> and we
shall try to illustrate the coincidence of these with the religion of the
ancient Mongols by a few examples.</p>
<p>Among many hymns to Mithras in the Avesta there is an
important text. Ahura Mazdah turned to Spitama-Zarathustra saying: &quot;In
truth, when I created Mithras, lord of the wide pastures, O Spitama, I created
him as worthy of sacrifice and prayers as I, Ahura Mazdah, am myself. The Evil
One who will lie to Mithras [or will break the contract] will bring death to the
whole land, will cause the world as much evil as a hundred sinners. O Spitama,
do not break the contract, either with the believers, or with the unbelievers,
since Mithras is for the faithful and for the infidel.&quot;  <a name="sik4text98"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note98">[+98]</a></p>
<p>Ancient Mithras, the genius of heavenly light, was honoured
equally with Ahura Mazdah, and Darius Hystaspes allocated equally honoured
positions to the emblems of Ormuzd and Mithras on the walls of his burial vault
 <a name="sik4text99"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note99">[+99]</a> (486 B.C.). Sometimes Mithras is considered a deity combining male and
female. Symbols of a god and a goddess are found on certain Mithraic monuments.
On many bas-reliefs Mithras is shown stabbing a bull or sheep, which indicates
the cult's link with sacrifice, but the main activities of the cult were
performed in secret. By a special decree Xerxes forbad the honouring of the <i>devas
</i>in his empire, but Mithras and Anaitis were excluded from the number of the
persecuted gods and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{275} </font></b>are
mentioned in an inscription of Artaxerxes as allies of Ahura Mazdah.</p>
<p>The cult of Mithras in Iran, however, was displaced by
worship of the Amesha spenta, and later Mithras appears as an independent deity
in between Ormuzd and Ahriman.  <a name="sik4text100"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note100">[+100]</a> The significance of the Mithras cult in Iran
had noticeably declined, and its divergences from Zoroastrianism had increased.
On the other hand, the Mithras cult flourished in Asia Minor. Mithridates
Eupator was a worshipper and the Cilician pirates from whom Roman soldiers and
then the soldier emperors  <a name="sik4text101"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note101">[+101]</a> - for example, Aurelian, Diocletian, Julian the
Apostate - borrowed the cult of Mithras, while in Iran it was Bahram Chubin, the
&quot;rebel who worships Mithra` as a seventh-century Christian author called
him.  <a name="sik4text102"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note102">[+102]</a></p>
<p>Western Mithraism, worship of the &quot;Unconquerable
Sun&quot;, did not withstand competition with Christianity and Islam and
disappeared without trace. But in the East it survived among the Heptalites
where the king Mihirakul was its champion against Buddhism.  <a name="sik4text103"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note103">[+103]</a> The kingdom of
the Heptalites included Dardistan and Western Tibet in the early sixth century.
 <a name="sik4text104"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note104">[+104]</a> Thus, cultural interchange between the Heptalites and the land of Shanshun
was easy and even unavoidable.</p>
<p>According to the basic thesis of Mithraism, Heaven with its
spouse the Earth rules all the other gods begotten by this basic two-in-one
deity. Is this not the cult we find among the Tibetans and Mongols until their
acceptance of Buddhism? Further: the Earth-producer, <i>terra Mater, </i>fertilised
by water, has an important place in both rituals and teaching.  <a name="sik4text105"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note105">[+105]</a></p>
<p>The similarity of the teachings of Mithraism and Bon, though,
is not merely or particularly a matter of cult details. Eastern Mithraism kept
its archaic features and did not become, like the western form, a religion of
victory or military success, but remained a teaching of the struggle for truth
and loyalty. It did not turn into the &quot;Unconquerable Sun&quot;, but
retained its cosmic nature, where the sun was merely <b><font COLOR="#943634">{276}
</font></b>the &quot;eye of Mithras&quot; and Mithras himself a
deity-prophet, the Light of Day. The lie, deceit and treachery, understood as
abuse of trust,  <a name="sik4text106"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note106">[+106]</a> were the enemy of the eastern Mithras as of the Bon
&quot;Light of Day&quot;. It is this dogma and its simultaneously psychological
feature that relates Mithraism with the religion of Bon and its branches among
the ancient Mongols.</p>
<p>Finally, a question: why was Mithraism so unable to get on
with Buddhism, although it quite quietly allowed Christianity and Islam to
swallow it up? Common to Buddhism and Bon (Mithraism) is an injunction to the
believers to engage in good deeds and aspire to self-improvement; but in the two
cases the understanding of the good and the perfection for which one should
strive are diametrically opposed. The Buddhists consider the good either
&quot;non-action&quot;, or the propaganda of their teaching, which, in the last
analysis, amounts to the same &quot;non-action&quot;, the aim being complete
disappearance from the round of rebirths. The Mithraists, on the contrary,
prescribe a struggle for truth and justice, i.e. military deeds, and wartime
hermits are regarded as deserters. From the point of view of a Buddhist the
world is an abode of torment from which one must flee; ceasing to restore life,
i.e. not marrying, is a necessary condition of salvation. In Mithraism, Mithra
is the &quot;lord of wide fields&quot; which he makes fertile. He increases the
number of the herds; he also gives those who are honest health, abundance and
wealth. He is the one who distributes not only material blessings, but also
spiritual ones.  <a name="sik4text107"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note107">[+107]</a></p>
<p>In brief, Mithraism is a life-asserting system. But if this
is so, the creed of a struggle with life, the assertion that the beautiful world
around us is <i>maya </i>(illusion), that complete inactivity is the most
appropriate pursuit for a talented man and that the best means for good to
triumph is non-resistance to evil, is to the Mithraist and adherent of Bon a
monstrous lie, and one has to struggle against the lie. The law prescribes it.
That is why Buddhism encountered such bitter resistance in Tibet and Mongolia;
and it conquered, and that incompletely, only when internal wars had carried the
most active section of the people into the abyss and those remaining had neither
strength nor desire to oppose the new teaching which promised <b><font COLOR="#943634">{277}
</font></b>peace and called on them to leave this hard world of
suffering. It was then that the Yellow Faith triumphed in Asia.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Bon</h4>
<p>At the present time Bon is professed in Sikkim, to some
extent in Bhutan, in the south-west provinces of China (Sichuan and Yunnan) by
the south Chinese minorities, the Miao, Lolo, Lisu and others, and also in
Western Tibet. Materials on the Bon religion are extremely scanty. There are the
notes of the Moravian missionary Francke  <a name="sik4text108"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note108">[+108]</a> and the diplomatic agent Bell  <a name="sik4text109"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note109">[+109]</a>
and, finally, a genuine Bon manuscript obtained by Sarat Chandra Das and partly
translated into German by Laufer.  <a name="sik4text110"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note110">[+110]</a> The most complete modern research on Bon
is contained in the works by Hoffman  <a name="sik4text111"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note111">[+111]</a> and Stein.  <a name="sik4text112"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note112">[+112]</a> Information given on
Bon in European works is contradictory and confused. As for descriptions of Bon
in Tibetan sources compiled by Buddhists, there one has to consider the
possibility of deliberate falsification.</p>
<p>The deity worshipped by the Bon has the name Kuntu Zanpo (kun
tu bzang po), literally the &quot;All-Good&quot;. But since nothing can,
according to the Bon, appear on this earth without a mother and father, along
with this deity there exists a goddess who appears now as the tender &quot;Great
Mother of Mercy and Love&quot;, now as the angry &quot;Glorious Queen of the
Three Worlds&quot; who rules all the world, including China, Tibet, Shanshun and
Li (Khotan).  <a name="sik4text113"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note113">[+113]</a> This goddess is honoured even more than her husband, since her
power is linked with the earth, as a consequence of which she is called in
Western Tibet the Earth-Mother.  <a name="sik4text114"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note114">[+114]</a></p>
<p>According to Bon cosmology, the world is made up of three
spheres: the heavenly region of the gods is of white light, the earthly region
of people is of red light and the lower world of water spirits is of blue light.
The mystic world tree grows through all three universes and is the means by
which the worlds communicate with one <b><font COLOR="#943634">{278}
</font></b>another. According to one of the Bon versions, a
wonderful man between being and non-being, who came to be called the
&quot;Created, lord of what is&quot;, appeared in the world which then had
neither form nor reality. In the world at that time there were no seasons,
forests grew of themselves, but there were no animals. Then white light and
black light arose, and then a black man appeared, the personification of evil,
creator of discord and war. But a white man also appears, surrounded by light,
who is called &quot;He who loves all that is&quot;. He gives warmth to the sun,
orders the stars, issues laws and so on.  <a name="sik4text115"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note115">[+115]</a></p>
<p>The Tibetans know many kinds of demons differing greatly from
one another. These were the <i>lha, </i>celestial beings, good spirits of white
colour, mostly men. They are life-giving, though <i>Da-lha {Dgra-lha) </i>the
god of war is savage and strong like the greatest devil. Petty spirits of this
sort are used as defenders of lamaism. Evil spirits, the <i>tsan (btsan), </i>men
of red colour inhabit the earth. Usually this type of being is the vengeful
spirit of a prophet dissatisfied with his death. They dwell predominantly around
temples. The main enemies of mankind are the <i>dud (bdud, mara) </i>demons,
mostly men of black colour and very malicious. The most evil of these are the <i>de
(Jdre) </i>or <i>lhade (lha'dre), </i>men and women. The other spirits are
considerably less important in strength and scope than those described. Demons
of the stars, the <i>don (gdon), </i>many-coloured, which cause illness,
man-eating demons, the <i>sinpo (srin po) </i>and many others are listed.</p>
<p>An analogous system of demonology, though not so developed,
is noted throughout the whole of northern Eurasia. This system relates the world
views of the different Asiatic nomads to one another, despite the fact that they
profess a variety of religions: demons, after all, are not an object of worship;
all you can do is to defend yourself against them. Since many ethnographers have
failed to take account of this and have equated beliefs with religion, the idea
that Bon is a Tibetan form of shamanism was tacitly accepted. Here, again, a
confusion of two concepts occurred: shamanism is the practice of ecstasy with a
nature-philosophy base, but Bon is a religion. These concepts are mutually
incommensurable.</p>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{279}</font></p>
<h4></b>A Faith, but not a Religion</h4>
<p>Apart from the beliefs we have expounded, which we may boldly
class as religious conceptions, there were many others in the consciousness of
the thirteenth-century Mongols that had no connection with dogma and theodicy.
Among these are belief in wizardry, divination and omens.</p>
<p>These phenomena are often put in the sphere of religion, but
I see no reason for that. Religion sets as its aim communication with god and an
explanation of the relations of man to god. Wizardry, i.e. magic, is based on
the principles: (1) everything in the world is interrelated and (2) like gives
rise to like.  <a name="sik4text116"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note116">[+116]</a> The presence of god is not obligatory for the wizard, nor are
spirit forces.</p>
<p>Equally, when a man engaged in divination it does not matter
whether he uses the shoulder blade of a sheep, beans or the cards; he does not
summon any supernatural power.</p>
<p>Omens are the clearest example that not every belief is of a
religious nature. All know the evil omen: to be the third to light up from one
match - death or great trouble. It made sense during the Boer war, when Boer
snipers unfailingly fired at the flare of a match if it was held even for an
instant. But this omen is extremely widespread throughout Europe, though it is
in no way linked with either a materialist or a Christian view of the world.
But, then, you cannot call this belief pagan. Here there is no poetic myth, no
fantastic demonology, no heartfelt, though mistaken, interpretation of the
forces of the cosmos and chaos. Here is simply a badly understood pattern based
on <i>post hoc, ergo propter hoc, </i>which from any point of view must be
called a superstition. And superstition is a feature of all periods.</p>
<p>Mongols were forbidden on pain of death to bathe or wash
their clothes in summer. Veselovskii tried to interpret this unhygienic measure
as a manifestation of shamanist water worship (?!).  <a name="sik4text117"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note117">[+117]</a> But I think we are here
dealing with an omen. Rashid ad-Din explains this prohibition as due to the
Mongol belief that bathing causes thunderstorms.  <a name="sik4text118"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note118">[+118]</a> A storm in the steppe is a
great misfortune, since lightning strikes vertical objects, i.e. men and
livestock. Two or three <b><font COLOR="#943634">{280} </font></b>coincidences
could create an omen which afterwards long persisted. But this prohibition could
have no direct relation to religion.</p>
<p>We may say the same of the &quot;cult of the threshold&quot;.
The first travellers to Mongolia noted that touching the threshold of the khan's
yurt was punished by death. They therefore supposed that the Mongols honoured
the &quot;spirit of the threshold&quot; and counted touching the threshold as
sacrilege. It seems to me, however, that it was not quite like that. A monk who
accompanied Rubruck touched the threshold of Mongke-khan's yurt and was
immediately arrested and sent to the highest court. But in the inquiry it became
clear that the monk had no idea of this custom and he was released and only
forbidden to go in to the khan.  <a name="sik4text119"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note119">[+119]</a> Had there been a question of sacrilege
here, ignorance would not have saved the monk. Most likely we are not dealing
with a cult, but with an omen according to which touching the threshold brings
misfortune to the master of the house. Therefore, to stand on someone else's
threshold means to wish him ill, to touch it means to show him lack of
consideration, and lack of consideration for a khan is an insult to his rank. As
the monk, in touching the threshold, simply showed his ignorance of others&quot;
customs he was not subject to punishment. One should never confuse omens with a
cult.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Not Shamanism</h4>
<p>I believe N. Veselovskii made a serious mistake in
considering the beliefs he had described as manifestations of shamanism,
allegedly the Mongols&quot; state religion.  <a name="sik4text120"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note120">[+120]</a></p>
<p>Our reason is very inclined to fall into one logical mistake:
to accept words as terms. Thus, under the concept of shamanism we put a large
number of extremely varied beliefs. Therefore, before speaking of shamanism we
should make this concept more precise. The shaman is a man chosen by a spirit,
not a world spirit, but a personal, female one, as a husband and for this reason
he enjoys its protection.  <a name="sik4text121"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note121">[+121]</a> Thanks to the spirit's protection the shaman can
both divine and cure, i.e. drive off other spirits and accompany the soul of the
dead to the place of rest. The presence of such shamans <b><font COLOR="#943634">{281}
</font></b>among the Mongols of later times is not in doubt, but
the image of Kokochu-Teb-Tenggeri is not that at all. Teb-Tenggeri does not
engage in wizardry, he prophesies the will of heaven.</p>
<p>What is there in common between this priest and a frenzied
medium at a spiritualist seance (which is what a shaman's performance is, in
essence), apart from the name we have arbitrarily given it? Moreover, in the
Concealed Tale there is a description of genuine shamanist activity this was the
curing of Ogedei by redeeming his life with that of a relative.  <a name="sik4text122"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note122">[+122]</a> But it
turns out that Chinese, i.e. Kara-Khitan shamans were summoned for the cure.</p>
<p>Piano Carpini and Rubruck also tell us of shamanism, but they
call the shaman <i>kam</i>. This is an Altai Turkish word, and in the thirteenth
century shamanism had been considerably developed in the Altai where it existed
along with Nestorianism. For example, Rashid ad-Din says that at one time the
Naiman khan had such power over the jinn that he used to milk them and make
kumis from their milk. As regards the Mongols proper, however, we are obliged to
abandon the traditional viewpoint and agree with Mongke-khan who told Rubruck
that the Mongols learn the will of the One God through prophets (but not wizards
- L.G.).</p>
<p>If this is so, then the thought strikes us that shamanism in
the restricted and direct meaning of the word developed as an ideological system
in direct proximity to Mongolia and, it seems, at the same period. As we have
found it among the Kara-Khitan and the Naiman, it is natural to seek its origin
in the homeland of these peoples, i.e. Manchuria. In fact, we find the
conceptions, rituals and terminology sought for there in the Jurchen Qin empire.
Certain researchers consider the word &quot;shaman&quot; itself a Jurchen one,
 <a name="sik4text123"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note123">[+123]</a> and the Jurchen the originators of shamanism.  <a name="sik4text124"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note124">[+124]</a> The Jurchen considered
people with outstanding abilities shamans,  <a name="sik4text125"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note125">[+125]</a> just as we call them geniuses,
from the Latin word &quot;genius&quot;, the protective spirit of the clan.</p>
<p>The Khitan even had a shaman hierarchy the ordinary shaman
cured and engaged in wizardry, but the secret rituals took place under the
guidance of a supreme shaman who had a high position in <b><font COLOR="#943634">{282}
</font></b>the Liao Empire. This genuine shamanism was recorded
in 1714 when the Manchurian ritual was unified. The deities of the Manchurians
were defined as spirits with whom links were established through male and female
shamans.  <a name="sik4text126"></a><a href="sik4c.htm#sik4note126">[+126]</a> In brief, shamanism also was a state world-view, though not among
the Mongols, but among their eastern neighbours. Both ideological systems, the
theistic and the spiritualist, were neighbours for many centuries, co-existed
and interacted, but did not fuse, for their dogma and origins were different.
Shamanism turned out to be more long lasting and beat the highly developed
religions - Bon and Nestorianism - which disappeared in Mongolia, and this
confused the nineteenth-century scholars who tried to lump together all the
faiths of ancient times; but to contemporaries of those events the distinction
of Mongol religion from other Asian cults was obvious. All knowledgeable
observers considered the Mongol faith as monotheism, but neither Muslims nor
Christians noted any similarity between the Mongol faith and their own.</p>
<p>Thus, the ancient Mongol religion appears before us as a view
of the world that had been carefully worked out, with an ontology (a teaching of
a two-in-one deity, creator and provider), a cosmology (the conception of the
three worlds with possible inter-communication), ethics (condemnation of the
lie), mythology (the legend of an origin from the &quot;sun man') and a
demonology (distinguishing the ancestor spirits from the spirits of nature). It
was so different from Buddhism, Islam and Christianity that contacts between the
representatives of these religions could only be political. Moreover, the
ancient Mongol culture was so specific that any borrowing from it, or simply a
veiled reference to it, is easily recognised. We shall now deal with this,
taking as an example the situation most familiar to us, Ancient Rus&quot; in the
twelfth to thirteenth centuries.</p>
