<h4 align="center"><b>OUR INNER NATURE</b></h4>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><i>in which is shown what part of man belongs to nature and what not, and what part of
  the world outside the human body is outside nature, and also why everything said here find
  above still does not answer the problem of ethnogenesis</i></p>
  <p>&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">Ethnos and Population</h4>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><strong><font color="#FF0000">An ethnos is not a population.</font></strong> </i>Now
and then ordinary phenomena give grounds for scientific conclusions whose perspectives go
beyond schoolboy notions. In the science of ethnoi much has to be rethought and much of
the habitual rejected.</p>

<p>It may seem to the unsophisticated reader that an ethnos resembles an organism with
purely biological functions,, but that similarity is external, and the differences are
fundamental. An ethnos builds colonies and sometimes exists in diaspora, but a hand or ear
separated from the body dies. An organism must produce like progeny, but an ethnos (each
one) is unique and inimitable, and tradition does not cross the frontiers of superethnic
entities. The functions of an organism are outside social laws; an ethnos is constantly
interacting with social phenomena. An organism must sooner or later die, while there are
persistent ethnoi, and so on.</p>

<p>One cannot in any case equate an ethnos and a population, which may be regarded (among
animals) as the analogue of an ethnos. The difference is much greater than the similarity.
A population is an aggregate of individuals settled over several generations in a definite
territory-, within this aggregate free cross-breeding occurs, yet it is at the same time
separated from neighboring populations by a certain degree of isolation. An ethnos,
however, as we have seen, is not an aggregate of similar individuals but a system
comprising not only individuals who vary both genetically and functionally, but also the
products of their activity over many generations (technique, anthropogenic terrain, and
cultural tradition). A sense of historical time is characteristic of dynamic ethnoi, a
sense recorded by calendars with various systems of reference. But the absence of
historical time as an ethno-psychological category of ethnoi during the phase of
homeostasis does not give us any right to treat them only as populations. Even a static
ethnos may quite freely change its area, within certain limits, of course, migrating with
changes in the geographical environment in search of accustomed conditions. Cross-breeding
within an ethnos is regulated either by class or estate relations, or by traditional bans
on incest, or by norms of law and religion. When these bans are relaxed, which sometimes
happens, it is always a symptom of the approaching disintegration of the ethnos.</p>

<p>Finally, the, character of ethnic isolation from neighbors is not associated with
territory. When territorial mixing of two populations occurs, they immediately merge into
one, but two or more ethnoi can coexist in one territory for ages, forming either a
superethnos or a zone of ethnic contact at any level. Struggle between ethnoi, on the
contrary, is a frequent phenomenon, even though inexplicable from the standpoint of the
struggle for survival, because it is often not provoked by overpopulation of the area. But
struggle between populations as discrete (corpuscular) systems is impossible because the
aim of the individual in a population is to survive itself and have progeny.</p>

<p>The flock and herd forms of the existence of populations of higher mammals at first
glance resemble elementary ethnoi. But the resemblance is illusory. Flocks are family
nuclei, monogamous, polygamous, or seasonal. They break up as soon as the male, the
leader, grows weak and loses influence over his own offspring. An ethnos grows from a
consortium, i.e. a group of people united by a common fate. If they are men only, they get
wives from outside and family relations arise in the second generation. Family ties
promote consolidation of a rising ethnos, but are not obligatory, because cases have been
observed of broad exogamy, which is particularly clear in the establishing harems.</p>

<p>An ethnos is thus not so much a population as a special phenomenon proper only to
mankind that is manifested through social forms, in every case original, because the
economy of a country is always linked with the supporting terrain, the level of
development of technique, and the character of production relations. That does not mean,
of course, that the ethnologist should ignore population genetics, but rather that he
should understand that it reflects only one, and not the main aspect of the process I am
studying. Therefore let me try and draw facts from it useful for further analysis.</p>

<p>It is very important to note that every population includes many different genotypes.
The concentrations of genotypes differ in various populations, but each group of
populations contains almost all the genotype combinations met in a given species. Small
populations, however, lose certain genotypes, as a consequence of which their degree of
variability is altered, and their capacity to adapt correspondingly reduced. That is known
as degeneration. Most populations are in a state of dynamic equilibrium according to the
principles of population genetics, differing among themselves in scale, structure, and
genetic composition. Equilibrium is upset by the influence of factors of evolution, the
mutation process, quantitative fluctuations or 'waves of life', as a consequence of a
disturbance of isolation and natural selection. As a result of these effects there is
either expansion or a reduction of the size of both the genotypes and of the whole
populations, and in some cases mutations or fluctuations will lead to interspecific
conversion or species formation. Since an ethnos is within a species, a trifling mutation
pressure, compared with the species, will be sufficient for its formation, with the
existence of a relatively smallish isolation and slight change of fluctuations. Ethnoi
therefore arise more often than species, but there are also much fewer periods in which
these processes are recorded by history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><em><strong>Monomorphism.</strong></em></font> </i>When we
observe ethnic history, we readily note that periods of stability associated with an
ethnos' attainment of maximum adaptation to one terrain or another are discoverable in the
seemingly continuous process of transformation. These observations coincide with the
conclusions drawn by the ichthyologist Yu.P. Altukhov and anthropologist Yu.G. Rychkov
from population genetics, who supplemented the thesis by pointing to the 'unadaptability
at interspecific level of heritable variations having adaptive significance within a
species', from which it follows that 'real movement is converted into resistance to
change', <a name="ebe4text1"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note1">[+1]</a> which maintains the isolates for an unlimited
length of time. But if opposite processes were not observed, even though not constantly
operating, it would be impossible for there to be species formation in the animal kingdom
or for new ethnoi to arise that oust the isolates. They proposed the following answer to
that.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">A change in unique species properties should mean, in rare cases,
  the birth of a new Species. But that is only imaginable as a unique, solitary event
  accompanied with the reproductive isolation of different individuals, and not as a
  constant stochastic process occurring at population level. <a name="ebe4text2"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note2">[+2]</a>
  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>If we apply that thesis to ethnology it will be a conception of excess, i.e. of an
impulse whose results could only be manifested in specially favorable conditions of
lability of the environment. In other situations the inertia of the impulse would be
cancelled and the 'different individuals', would perish at the hands of fellow-tribesmen.
And it is a matter of indifference here whether the ethnos containing people dissimilar to
itself is in a state of persistent rest-homeostasis-or whether it is being carried along
by the stream of ethnic becoming through all its varied phases. In either case it will
kill those whom it will justly (from its point of view) call monsters or degenerates. Yet
new ethnoi appear, which means that conditions exist such as enable 'different
individuals' not only to survive but even to win. These are obviously conditions of the
environment, both territorial and ethnic, by which is understood, so to say, the character
of the relationships between the neighbors of the studied individual. But if it is very
difficult for us to trace the biographies of ancient people who did not manage to manifest
themselves because of the envy, obtuseness, and maliciousness of fellow-tribesmen or
fellow-citizens, then, when we pass to study of systems of several orders higher, i.e.
ethnoi, we get the data we need to help us substantiate the conception of excess as the
initial moment of ethnogenesis. And the bigger the studied system is the fewer will be the
assumptions needed and the magnitude of the mistakes. From all of what has been said above
it will be obvious that ethnoi are biophysical realities always surrounded by a social
envelope of some sort. The dispute about which is primary in the origin of a new ethnos -
the biological or the social - is consequently like that about which is primary in an egg
- the albumen (white) or the shell. Clearly, the one is impossible without the other, so
that dispute on this theme is pointless.</p>

<p>In actual fact a constant conjugation of all forms of the motion of matter is observed
not only within large, collectives (ethnoi that directly influence the terrestrial terrain
and consequently do not exist as abstractions but are quite real) but also within one
human individual. Even when we consider that all the details of a person's behavior are
dictated by his social surroundings, the individual's genetic code is a biological
phenomenon and lowered secretion of adrenaline a chemical one. But both strongly influence
the character of a parson's activity, along with social factors.</p>

<p>Any superficial observer who ignores history will remain faithful to the principle of
simplification when speaking of the interaction of man and his natural environment. It
will seem obvious that where there are favorable conditions promoting rapid growth of
labour productivity and population, the progress of human society will be rapid, and where
they are not it will be slow. But what conditions are considered favorable? The climate in
Andalusia is milder than in England and Castile, but Grenada was conquered by the
Castilians in 1492, and England was the ruler of the seas for almost 500 years. The
geographical conditions of Norway did not alter for 2 000 years, but the Vikings only
ploughed the waves of the ocean from the ninth to the twelfth centuries, while there was
stagnation there before the ninth century A.D., and Danish occupation from the time of the
Kalmar Union. Why?</p>

<p>It remains to suggest that flashes of ethnogenesis are not connected with the culture
and life of peoples that are developing or stagnating, with racial composition, with the
level of their economy and technique, and with fluctuations of climate changing an ethnos'
ecology, but are associated with special conditions of space and time. The landscape does
not of itself generate new ethnoi because it has to be stated that they sometimes do not
arise in some one place, even very favourable, for whole millennia. The regions of
ethnogenesis are changing all the time. The process interesting me begins now here, now
there, which means it is not brought about by the terrestrial forces that we have already
taken into account but is prompted by something else that we must look for.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Background and factor.</strong></font> </i>Analysis of
the interaction of an ethnos as an independent phenomenon, with the terrain, indicated
that they are interconnected, but neither the ethnos is a constantly operating
landscape-forming factor nor can the terrain be a cause of ethnogenesis without an
external influence. The relation of the ethnic and social patterns actually excludes even
a feedback, because Earth's ethnosphere is only the background for social development and
not a factor of it.</p>

<p>Take the simplest variant, the single human individual. Anatomy, physiology, and
psychology are closely interwoven in a person and depend on one another, thereby it is not
necessary in my analysis in the differentiation of these aspects of human existence. Man,
clearly, is a social being because his personality is molded in ceaseless intercourse with
other people and with objects created by the hands of his forefathers (technique). So. But
the spermatozoon? It is a purely biological 'person' that develops according to the laws
of the evolution of vertebrates. But the human personality's link with its own embryo is
beyond doubt, and the human body itself, including its higher nervous activity, is
consequently a laboratory in which the social and natural forms of the motion of matter
are combined.</p>

<p>But even when passing through the incubation period and wholly entering the social
environment, a human individual is governed by certain natural laws and patterns. The
periods of sexual maturation and aging depend on inherited attributes developed during
intraspecific evolution rather than on degree of social development. Sexual maturity sets
in earlier, for example, among the peoples of the tropical belt than among northerners;
the speed of the Negroids' reaction is faster than the Europeoids' and Mongoloids';
resistance to certain diseases, measles for example, is lower among Polynesians than among
Europeans, and so on. These features have no relation to social development, but affect
the behaviour of the people of various countries. The origin of these differences is
undoubtedly linked with the adaptation of the ancestors of one population or another to
different geographical conditions and with the formation of ethnoi both past and now
living. It is the accumulation of characteristics arising as a result of lengthy processes
of adaptation that creates ethnic diversity when mankind passes through identical stages
of development, i.e. socioeconomic formations. But the complexity of the problem of
ethnogenesis is not exhausted by social formations. For then ethnography would be simply a
part of sociology, and societies belonging to one formation (the slaveowning, say) would
behave in the same way. But Chinese antiquity not only differs from the Hellenic but also
from the Japanese, Indian, or Egyptian. Social similarity does not eliminate ethnic
originality.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Complementariness.</strong></font> </i>But can we
accept the idea that an ethnos is a biological magnitude? No. That too is not a solution,
since ethnic processes take place in the conditions of monomorphic species.</p>

<p>Yet, for all that, some of man's biological peculiarities seemingly play a certain
role. Assume that ethnogenesis, as a global phenomenon, is only a special case of general
ecology; this 'particularity' is extremely important, however, because, when posing the
problem of the original genesis of an ethnic entity from individuals (people) of mixed
origin, different level of culture, and different peculiarities, we have the right to ask
what draws them together. The principle of conscious calculation and striving for benefit
is not present, obviously, because the first generation comes up against enormous
difficulties, i.e. the need to break established relationships so as to establish new ones
that meet their needs in place of them. That is always a risky business, and the
initiators seldom manage to reap the fruits of victory. The principle of social nearness,
too, does not fit, since a new ethnos eliminates the institutions of the old.
Consequently, a person needs to be declassed as regards the old in order to become part of
a new ethnos when it is being formed.</p>

<p>But what if another principle is applied, that of complementariness linked with the
subconscious mutual sympathy of individuals? That principle underlies marriage for love,
but complementariness cannot be limited to the sphere of sex, which is only a variant of
its manifestation. The main role in the forming of an initial collective, the embryo of an
ethnos, is played by unconscious attraction of people of a definite kind for one another.
There is always such an attraction, but when it is intensified the precondition necessary
for the rise of an ethnic tradition is created. After that social institutions arise.</p>

<p>The birth of any social institution is thus preceded by an embryo, the union of a
certain number of people sympathetic to one another. Having begun to act they become part
of the historical process, cemented together by the aim they have chosen and historical
fate. But whatever shape their fate takes it is a <i>sine qua non. </i>Such a group can be
a robber band of Vikings, the religious sect of Mormons, the Order of Templars, a Buddhist
community of monks, the school of Impressionists, and so on, but the common multiple is
subconscious mutual attraction, be it even in order to argue with one another. I therefore
called these embryonic associations consortia above. Not every one of them survives. Most
disintegrate during the lifetime of their founders, but those that succeed in surviving
become part of the history of society and immediately become overgrown with social forms,
often creating a tradition. The few whose fate is not brought to an end by blows from
outside, survive until the natural loss of heightened activity, but retain the inertia of
mutual attraction, which is manifested by common habits, feelings about the world, tastes,
etc. I call that phase of complementary association convicinity. It comes into the
competence of ethnography rather than sociology, since this group is united by everyday
life. In favourable conditions convicinities are stable, but their resistance to the
environment tends to zero, and as a consequence of minimum resistance they become
dissolved among surrounding consortia.</p>

<p>The principle of complementarity also operates at the level of the ethnos, being very
active there. Then it is called patriotism and falls within the competence of history,
because it is impossible to like a people without respecting its ancestors. Intraethnic
complementariness is useful as a rule for an ethnos, being a powerful defensive force. But
it sometimes takes a monstrous, negative form of hatred of everything foreign. Then it is
called chauvinism.</p>

<p>But complementariness can only be speculative at the level of a superethnos. It is
usually expressed in arrogance and haughtiness, when all alien people unlike oneself are
called 'savages'.</p>

<p>The principle of complementarity does not relate to social phenomenon. It is observed
in wild animals and is familiar to everyone in domestic animals in both positive forms
(the affection of a dog or a horse for its master) and in negative ones. As we have seen,
this principle plays a leading role only in the absence of social forms of the life of a
collective, but it remains subordinate even when there are stable social establishments.
That prompts me to return to the biology of man, which has fortunately been adequately
developed.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><em><strong><font color="#FF0000">Biological lines of investigation.</font> </strong></em></i>The
biological disciplines include not only anatomy and genetics but also sciences that study
manifestations of the organism connected with the environment (reflexology, ecology,
biocoenology, and ethology or the science of behaviour). I suggest that not everything
connected with the activity of an organism is social in its nature. Animals and birds as
well as man bring up and train their offspring. All herd animals have a system of signals,
a regulation of sexual relations within the herd, and sex-age specialization for defense
against enemies. The males defend the females and young. Can we call relationship of that
kind social in the sense of the social motion of matter? In the usage accepted in Soviet
science, no - because social development is based on the economic basis of making and
development of the productive forces through the use of tools. Social relations are always
connected with formations of one kind or another. That is the terminology accepted in
Soviet science, and to change it means to confuse ourselves and the reader. But collective
forms of the existence of a species were peculiar to our remote ancestors. Before man
became a social animal he was a gregarious one, which by no means belittles human dignity.</p>

<p>The effect of the collective on the individual's physiology has now been quite well
studied. Hypertension can arise even in a mouse, if it is teased, but one can hardly call
a composition of a mouse, laboratory assistant, and experimenter social in the sense we
accept.</p>

<p>How can biology help in my work? Let us begin <i>ab ovo. </i>Collective forms of social
life are common among many species of land animals, e.g. in an anthill, a herd of
ungulates, a flock of birds, and so on, but each species has its own character of the
forming of collectives. For the species <i>Homo sapiens </i>this is the ethnos, but that
by no means implies that it is the analogue of an anthill or a herd. Just as man differs
from other vertebrates (and he differs radically) so ethnoi are not similar to the
collectives of other animals.</p>

<p>There are very many differences between animal collectives and ethnoi, but I shall
limit myself for purposes of analysis to the elementary scheme I need in order to work out
the role of cultural tradition. Imagine a tribe that had common ancestors. that is living
on the old normal territory and distinctly differentiated by way of life, customs,
religion, and kind of occupations from its neighbors. In that situation marriages will
mostly be concluded between members of this ethnos, since it will be pointless to bring
someone into the collective who does not have the skills and living habits necessary t I o
support a family in comfortable circumstances. Other skills, connected with other
conditions, will be obviously unacceptable. The cultural image of an isolated ethnos
without powerful interference of outside forces (conquest) is relatively stable because
each new generation will tend to reproduce the life cycle of the foregoing, which is
precisely the cultural tradition of the ethnos.</p>

<p>It would seem that tradition cannot be classed in any case as biology, but the
mechanism of the interaction between generations discovered by Prof. M.Ye. Lobashev <a name="ebe4text3"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note3">[+3]</a> precisely through study of animals, among which he
discovered processes of 'signal heredity, is simply another name for tradition. Individual
adaptation comes about in the animal kingdom through the mechanism of conditioned
reflexes, which provides the animal with an active choice of optimum conditions for life
and self-defense. These reflexes are passed on by parents to children, or by the senior
members of the herd to the junior, thanks to which the stereotype of behaviour is the
highest form of adaptation. In man this phenomenon is called continuity of civilization,
which is ensured by the 'signal of signals', speech. This continuity includes living
habits and skins, ways of thinking, appreciation of objets d'art, treatment of elders and
relations between sexes that ensure optimum adaptation to the environment and are
transmitted through signal heredity. In combination with endogamy, i.e. isolation from
neighbors, which stabilizes the gene fund, tradition serves as a factor creating stability
of the ethnic collective.</p>

<p>Finally, anthropogenetics and anthropology, which treat populations of the species <i>Homo
sapiens </i>in biological time, i.e. in succession of generations, are of no little
importance. The life of an ethnos is the superposition of biological time on historical,
or the succession of generations, on the chain of events by causal succession. The
superposition is done without breach of the causal pattern thanks to the combination of
genetic memory with historical succession as a consequence of which the ethnos exists as
an entity.</p>

<p>But even more important is the rise of the characteristic in a population that I call
X-factor; it is precisely because of it that processes of ethnogenesis are initiated that
subsequently die out. When we have distinguished this characteristic we win have solved
the problem posed but it is difficult to rind it because it had to be sought for
consistently.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">Phylogenesis or Ethnogenesis?</h4>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Progress and the evolution of man.</strong></font> </i>According
to the accepted theory of evolution, the genus Homo appeared at the beginning of the
Quaternary period in several varied forms of hominids, which possibly followed on one
another although they may have sometimes been coexistent. Like our presumed ancestor <i>Australopithecus,
</i>the hominids were large predators, not foreign to cannibalism, and consequently
occupied an upper ecological niche in the biocoenosis. By the end of the last ice age all
branches of this genus had died out, with the exception of just one species <i>Homo
sapiens, </i>i.e. modern man. But the latter spread all over the dry land of the planet,
and later in historical time mastered the surface of the hydrosphere and made such changes
on Earth that the whole relief envelope of Earth is now justly called the anthropogenic.
There is no region, with the exception of the polar ice-caps, where archaeological
memorials of the stone and iron ages have not been found. We find Paleolithic camp sites
in present-day deserts and jungles, and Neolithic ones in the modern tundra and taiga.
That points to past settlement of regions later abandoned by man and again being mastered
now by the use of machine technique. Over 17 to 20 millennia, of course, the climatic
conditions in various regions changed, but it remains a fact that <i>Homo sapiens, </i>unlike
other species of vertebrates, has not been limited to a certain area and has been able to
adapt itself to diverse natural conditions, which by rights puts it in a special place in
the ecology of vertebrates.</p>

<p>In the nineteenth century, and early twentieth, the advance of engineering made it
possible to rapaciously annihilate reserves of natural wealth, and that seemed the road of
progress. Now there is already a lack of fresh water for the needs of industry, flora have
been suppressed, dust storms are taking their revenge in the USA for the annihilation of
the biocoenoses of the prairies, the Aral Sea is shrinking, the air of big cities is
depleted of oxygen, 110 species of vertebrates have disappeared from the face of the earth
in the past 300 years, and another 600 species are in danger. That process was still
called progress not so long ago and victory over nature. Now it had become clear that we
are observing a phenomenon of a quite different (not social) order - the heightened
adaptability and aggressiveness of <i>Homo sapiens, </i>one of the components of the
biosphere of planet Earth. </p>

<p>And here arises the first question. How have these phenomena come about in the
evolution of vertebrates to which <i>Homo sapiens </i>himself belongs? And a second one,
no less important. Did man continue to remain part of the biocoenosis as the upper, final
link having created tools and learned to use fire, or did he pass to some other sphere of
interaction with nature drawing into it domesticated animals and cultivated plants? This
is the more essential because, according to the law of the irreversibility of evolution,
animals and plants altered unrecognizably by man's action cannot be returned to
independent life since, with a few exceptions, they are unable to compete with wild forms.
Thus a special substratum has been created in the biosphere. Will the principle of natural
selection operate in it?</p>

<p>Many supporters of the theory of evolution, Darwin included, considered, and consider,
that modern man continues to be subjected to that same natural selection that used to
operate on his ancestors. Others doubt that, citing the following grounds:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">The gradual weakening of the struggle for existence inevitably led
  to man's exit from the biocoenosis. This slowly proceeding process led to natural
  selection first becoming weakened for man and then being quite suppressed... But the
  absence of natural selection was equivalent to cessation of the action of one of the
  factors of evolution ... and biological evolution of man should have stopped. That
  happened around 50 000 years ago with the forming of Cromagnon man. <a name="ebe4text4"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note4">[+4]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Ya.Ya. Roginsky and M.G. Levin wrote in 1955 that the process of biological evolution
had created in the person of modern man the possessor of species properties such as were
leading to the fading of evolution. <a name="ebe4text5"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note5">[+5]</a> There could
consequently, they claimed, be no doubt that man's evolutionary development had stopped
long ago. But, since modifications within the species continue, the matter (and with it
the posing of the problem) has not been settled. But a new aspect and a new method are
needed in order to continue the investigation, because only by describing the
peculiarities of the phenomenon can one go along with this or any other point of view.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Regional mutations.</strong></font> </i>Four years
after the appearance of Bystrov's book, G.F. Debets published a paper with astonishing
conclusions. The bones of the skull, massive in antiquity, had become finer (gracilization); and that had not happened gradually but by spurts, and not globally but
in latitudinal zones. <a name="ebe4text6"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note6">[+6]</a> Thus, gracilization of the skull
took place in the subtropical zone in the sixth millennium B.C., and in the temperate
forest zone in the first millennium B.C. Debets compared the dates of the transition from
hunting economy to agriculture with those dates, pointing out that 'one may suppose that
the transition to farming led to a change in the structure of the skull'. But it is
equally possible that changed man acquired a new occupation. Then Debets' following
consideration is quite justified: 'neither comparative anatomy nor ethnography give us the
right to consider that gracile forms are better within the species <i>Homo sapiens'. </i>Correct!
But it is well known that modification of one characteristic affects not only man's
anatomy but also his behaviour. Debets concluded 'that it is a matter of changes that have
biological substance'. <a name="ebe4text7"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note7">[+7]</a> Consequently biological
processes continue to take place in conditions of existence in human communities that
stimulate even changes of skeleton. But then there would also have to be variations of a
minor scale reflected in the physiology and behavior. It is much more difficult to
discover them, but the assumption of their existence, now there is a precedent, enables me
to begin the search for a factor of human activity that operates along with the well-known
social one. Can it be that this intraspecific evolution, which takes a peculiar form under
the impact of the social principle, is the spread of the species beyond its original area?
Or perhaps there is something new that has not yet been studied? Let us see.</p>

<p>Paleontology provides the main material for the theory of evolution, but one must
remember that its chronicle is not full, and the origin and extinction of species is still
a matter of polemic. The inexactness of the chronology presents special difficulty, the
assumptions in dating the appearance or disappearance of species sometimes exceeding
millions of years. We encounter similar difficulties when studying certain somatic
subdivisions of <i>Homo sapiens, pre</i>cisely the formation of races of the first order
(Europeoid, Mongoloid, Australoid, and Negroid). A purely biological approach to the
problem, even with a time limitation, consequently does not yield us any advantages. In
addition we must note that race affiliation is not connected in any way with the
heightened capacities of adaptation that enabled man to alter the face of the planet.
Finally, the major races are such indefinite communities that there are different
classifications of them in anthropology according to certain external characteristics
(pigmentation, skull structure, etc.). The main point is that the overwhelming majority of
individuals have as ancestors members of different races, if not of the first order then
of the second, and consequently the communities of people actually existing and directly
observable are always heterogeneous. But it is precisely they, known to us as
nationalities or ethnoi, that are collective forms of the existence of <i>Homo sapiens </i>that
interact with the landscape of the regions they populated, i.e. the elementary ecological
intraspecific taxons.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Conversion of the biocoenosis and succession.</strong></font>
</i>An established, or rather stable ethnos is not a danger either for its neighbors or
for landscapes. It is connected, together with its technique and spiritual culture, with
that geobiocoenosis in which it constituted the top, final fink, since it comes into the
cycle of conversion of the geobiocoenosis.</p>

<p>Let me explain. The English biologist Julian Huxley formulated the following thesis,
that the conversion cycle is the mechanism on which rests the circulation of energy among
plants and animals of a single habitat; in other words, it is the metabolism of the
ecological community belonging to this habitat, and that the conservation of a habitat
requires this circulation of energy to be maintained and intensified. <a name="ebe4text8"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note8">[+8]</a>
That point is quite essential for me. Natural growth in a stable ethnos was usually
limited in the past by high infantile mortality, and the maximum age reached by a married
couple was usually only attained when the ethnos was kept in equilibrium with the
environment and there was a certain insurance against exogenous effects (wars, epidemics,
natural calamities). The overcoming of these constantly arising difficulties took the
normal efforts of an isolated community. It always lacked aggressiveness and was incapable
of changing nature. Such ethnoi obviously cannot be the cause of cataclysms that
profoundly alter the nature of the regions occupied by them.</p>

<p>But other, diametrically opposite collisions often occur. Fairfield Osborn wrote in
1949 that the story of our (American) nation in the last century as regards the use of
forests, grasslands, wildlife and water sources is the most violent and the most
destructive of any written in the long history of civilization. Actually it is the story
of human energy unthinking and uncontrolled. <a name="ebe4text9"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note9">[+9]</a> But it
was also such from the standpoint of interethnic conflicts. The extermination of Indians,
the slave trade, the reprisals against the metises in Canada in 1885, the annexation of
Texas, the absorption of California and Alaska by gold-prospectors - all those events
happened in an unorganized way and without control. The governments of the USA and Canada
simply later sanctioned <i>fails accomplis </i>and profited by them.</p>

<p>But the Arab penetration of East Africa and the trekking of the Dutch settlers into the
Cape lands and then to the Orange River happened on the very same principle. Russian
explorers conquered Siberia by the same method, and the Chinese the lands to the south of
the Yangtse. The Hellenic colonization of the Mediterranean and the raids of the Vikings
did not differ from the events described. The campaigns of the Celts and the seizure of
Northern India by the Arians were seemingly the same in character. Consequently we come
across a frequently repeated phenomenon of the transition of an ethnos, or part of it,
into a dynamic state in which its aggressiveness and adaptive capacities grow immensely,
enabling it to adapt itself to new, hitherto unaccustomed conditions of existence.</p>

<p>All the actions described, and ones similar to them, called for colossal work (in the
physical sense) from those involved, equally physical, intellectual, and emotional. Any
work, to be productive, necessitates an expenditure of corresponding energy which has to
be drawn from somewhere or other. So what is this energy? Clearly it is not electrical or
mechanical, or thermal, or gravitational. And where do the people who are dashing ahead at
mortal risk get it from? Do they need such a dangerous amusement? But if they make use of
this energy, dying nevertheless more often than winning, it is legitimate to ask whether
or not the described phenomenon is related to the X-factor I am bent on finding. Perhaps.
But first let me pose the problem more precisely.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Anthroposuccession.</strong></font> </i>One must not
extend the peculiarity of <i>certain events </i>of history I have noted to <i>all </i>its
phenomena. That would be as much a mistake as to reduce <i>all</i> manifestations of human
activity to social principles. </p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">The great precept one must give historians is to distinguish instead
  of confusing, for unless it is varied it is not true at all. Unfortunately, mediocre minds
  have a taste for uniformity; uniformity is so convenient! If it distorts everything, at
  least it solves everything. <a name="ebe4text10"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note10">[+10]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>So Augustin Thierry wrote with anger; and how right he was! It is stupid, for instance,
to reduce the Seven Years' War, say, or Napoleon's conquest of Prussia to acts of God.
Events of that order become beautifully clear from the calculations of politicians
dictated to them by the sphere of social consciousness, and not by instincts. That is a
criterion of classification as clear as the psychological classification of an
individual's acts into conscious and subconscious. The indicator here is the existence of
free choice in decision-making and consequently moral and legal responsibility for one's
deeds. These two lines of behaviour in people's practical activity are never confused.
Thus love is considered natural in youth, but hooliganism and prostitution are punished by
law as deliberate willfulness; loss of hair and teeth in old age are not blamed on a
person, but they do not justify, say, involvement in service intrigues, although the
latter may be due to some extent to the existence of sclerosis. A similar approach to the
demarcating of historical phenomena of various kind may be employed in scholarly analysis,
as I once showed on the particular example of a description of the diversity of the
movements of the nomadic peoples of Eurasia depending on the humidity of the steppe zone.
Now I shall simply note that such a relation happens for the whole species <i>Homo
sapiens.</p>
</i>

<p>The migration of peoples to accustomed conditions is a striving to maintain themselves
as an ethnic system, and to keep from destroying the nourishing landscape.
Anthroposuccession, i.e. invasion of regions that cannot always be settled, or are not
always worth settling, but which can be conquered, is negative migration. And what is most
terrible, the victors suffer no less than the losers, because they are obliged, in order
to realize their success, to adapt themselves to new conditions, and that means a radical
break-up of their own nature. Clearly, only the young, most labile and plastic, i.e.
unstable, are capable of such a shake-up. But when the process is starting (succession or
aggression, as the reader wishes) these elements play only a subordinate role. For the
leading individuals the unleashing of a train of bloody events is inexpedient and
undesirable. But because anthroposuccessions happen all the same, it would seem their
causes lie outside that which is controllable by human consciousness. Then the dynamics
and statics of ethnogenesis are equally legitimate, and there are no categories of guilt
and responsibility in them. This thesis, it goes without saying, does not entail
all-forgiveness. Individual people, of course, are guilty of the crimes they commit,
irrespective of the phase of ethnogenesis. But ethnic patterns are of a higher order, and
both the statistical law of large numbers and Newton's third law (for every action there
is an equal and opposite reaction) apply to them - the victors perish together with the
vanquished or a little later, not in the sense of physical death, however, but in that of
ethnic reorganization. Unlike snakes, ethnoi change their souls rather than their skins.</p>

<h4 ALIGN="CENTER">When Immortality Is More Terrible Than Death</h4>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Phylogenesis becomes ethnogenesis.</strong></font> </i>The
dispute about whether man is a beast or a god that troubled the minds of romantics and
nihilists has now, happily, lost significance. It has become obvious that man is not only
an animal but is part of the animal kingdom, in spite of his other qualities, which not in
the least belittle his dignity. That is why he lives in collectives - in ethnoi or
specific communities. It is important for my theme to establish the place of the ethnos as
a specific phenomenon within the species <i>Homo sapiens, </i>to clarify how the relative
stability of an ethnos is maintained, and to understand the reasons for its origin (the
question of questions) and disappearance (which is simpler). It is therefore necessary to
establish that it is ethnic collectives that adapt to local conditions of some sort while
the stages of development, or formations, are global and their links with the geographical
environment are mediated by a mosaic anthroposphere, i.e. the ethnosphere, accessible to
the naturalist's observations. When we encounter a large number of events we can group
them on the principle of similarity and causal succession, i.e. apply the method of the
natural sciences to the historical material. And then we obtain a firm conclusion: ethnoi
arise and disappear independently of the existence of any notions of contemporaries, which
means that they are not the product of the social self-awareness of individual people,
although they are exclusively linked with forms of people's collective activity. Social
development lays its stamp on all other forms of the motion of matter in so far as they
are connected with people. But no one had ever tried to interpret gravitation or electric
conductivity, epidemics, death, and heredity in a social sense, because that is the field
of natural science. We have the right to treat the 'impulses' described above, and certain
similar phenomena, as anthropogenic succession. But I shall analyze the perplexity and
doubt arising with that a bit later when we are clarifying their cause, i.e. the very
enigmatic X-factor. But now let me get on with description of the phenomenon.</p>

<p>Over the past 5 000 years anthropogenic changes of the landscape have occurred more
than once, but with varying intensity and always within definite regions. When compared
with the history of mankind a clear link is established between anthropogenic changes of
nature, both creative and rapacious, and epochs of the molding of new ethnoi or of ethnic
migrations.</p>

<p>Both the rise of an ethnos and reorganization of the landscape in accordance with its
new aspirations, and the migration of a large number of people with weapons and tools are
work in the physical sense, which means they call for the expenditure of energy.
Furthermore, the maintenance of an ethnos as a system cannot proceed smoothly without an
expenditure of energy to overcome the constant resistance of the surroundings. And even
the decline of an ethnos, i.e. slowing down of its development, is linked with an
application of force against the cause that prompts acceleration.</p>

<p>When I formulated this thesis, <a name="ebe4text11"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note11">[+11]</a> it was supported
by Yu.K. Efremov, <a name="ebe4text12"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note12">[+12]</a> and later by Yu.V. Bromley, who
ascribed the authorship of it to Efremov, of which the latter, according to his sincere
personal declaration, was innocent. But it is even more astonishing that Prof. Bromley,
while recognizing the 'role of the bioenergetic source' in ethnic processes, suggests that
this energy 'depends on the concrete historical conditions of their (i.e. ethnic
communities') existence. <a name="ebe4text13"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note13">[+13]</a> The law of the conservation
of energy, it would seem, is not in need of defense, and it is inappropriate to start a
dispute on that score. Here it is important that other scholars recognize the presence of
a certain kind of energy for the performance of work to be necessary for ethnogenesis as a
process.</p>

<p>The characteristics of this specific form of energy are described in Vernadsky's
outstanding work: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">Everything living represents a continuously changing aggregate of
  organisms, linked together and undergoing an evolutionary process in the course of
  geological time. This is a dynamic equilibrium tending in the course of time to pass into
  a static equilibrium... The longer existence lasts, if there are no equivalent phenomena
  operating in the opposite direction, the closer to zero will be the free energy, [i.e.]
  the energy of living matter that manifests itself in the direction opposite to entropy.
  Because the development of free energy capable of doing work comes from the action of
  living matter. <a name="ebe4text14"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note14">[+14]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The structure of an ethnos and its stereotype of behaviour are consequently dynamic
quantities that are determined by the existence of an intraethnic evolution that is
equally dissimilar to the social and biological.</p>

<p>Translating this conclusion into the language of ethnology one can say that the fate of
all ethnoi is a gradual transition to ethno-relief equilibrium. By that I mean a situation
in which the ethnic collective, for example a tribe, becomes part of the biocoenosis of a
region, and growth of population, limited by the possibilities of the biochore, ceases. In
that aspect ethnoi have their place in geobiochemistry. The stable state of an ethnos is
that when all the energy obtained from the natural environment is swallowed up by internal
processes, and its output is zero; a dynamic stale is a suddenly arising capacity for a
greater intake of energy, and its output outside the ethnic system in the form of work;
the historical state is gradual loss of the ethnogenic attribute (the capacity to absorb a
large quantity of energy and to give it up purposively outside in the form of work), which
comes about through simplification of its structure.</p>

<p>But each relict (persistent) ethnos only exists because it was once formed, which means
it has survived the dynamic and historical phases of development. It is, consequently, on
the one hand, a crystallized form of the proceeding evolutionary process and, on the other
hand, the substratum for the rise of new ethnoi. During its formation any ethnos passes
through a destructive phase of reorganization and restructuring not only of the nature of
the region it has occupied but also of its own physiology and ethology (pattern of
behaviour), which is expressed in adaptation of its organism to the new conditions. Such
break-ups are not always possible. As we have seen, they occur in certain relatively rare
epochs of the spontaneous migrations of peoples. But then a stable system is established
for a long time that is recorded on ethnographic maps.</p>

<p>So, biological evolution within the species <i>Homo sapiens </i>continues, but has
acquired features not characteristic of other species of animals. Phylogenesis has been
converted into ethnogenesis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Evolution and ethnogenesis.</strong></font> </i>One
must not equate phylogenesis and ethnogenesis, of course, because new ethnoi remain within
the species. The analogy I have drawn is limited in principle, and because of that
explains the difference between macroevolutionary processes and micro ones. But while
recognizing the existence of modern man's biological evolution, the ethnologist cannot
agree with the forecasts of some of our Western contemporaries about the directional
development of the brain, which would alter the whole image of man.</p>

<p>J.B.S. Haldane drew a picture of a new species of hominid <i>Homo sapientissimus, </i>obviously
pandering to the tastes of his audience who wanted to see progress, and only progress, in
the future. But if that had been so, then people who lived 2 000 to 5 000 years before us
would have had marked somatic differences from us. One may recall the gracilization
discovered by Debets; but even that defender of the variability of races declared: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">Separate 'primitive ' and 'progressive' characteristics are found in
  all races, but none of them is distinguished by a 'primitive' or 'progressive' set of
  characteristics not previously counted as such. If we take the skull of an anthropoid ape,
  or even of Neanderthal man as the criterion of primitiveness, then the proto-European type
  of the Eneolithic epoch of the Russian plain will not be more primitive in the sum of its
  characteristics than the type of ancient Slavs or modern Ukrainians. <a name="ebe4text15"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note15">[+15]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The development of mankind has taken the line, reality, of extending the area and
increasing the number of intraspecific variations, i.e. ethnoi. Some of the latter have
perished, leaving material or literary memorials to posterity; some have remained in the
form of relicts; and some have disappeared without trace. But there has been no case when
the subconscious actions of populations with a single stereotype of behaviour led to
purposive changes of their own nature whatever the conditions created for this collective.</p>

<p>It transpires that people sometimes prefer valiant death to voluntary self-restraint to
save their life, which in that case loses any attraction for them. This feature of the
intraspecific psychological stereotype limits the possibilities of ethnogenesis as a local
process, and throws doubt on the analogy of ethnogenesis with evolution.</p>

<p>However strange that conclusion may seem, it is consistent and believable, because when
an ethnos acquires social forms, it creates political institutions that are not natural
phenomena. The Romans created the Senate, the consulate, the tribunate, and a system of
law, the Franks feudalism, the sixth-century Turks the 'Ehl' as a combination of tribal
unions and military formations (hordes), the Incas a complex structure of subordination of
Indian tribes to their own hierarchy, and so on. But all these institutions were the work
of human hands and, in that sense, similar to colonnaded temples, palaces, axes, and
clothing, which (as already said), not having possibilities of self-development, can only
be ruined by the action of time.</p>

<p>Forms created by human genius and labour resist the gradual disappearance of things,
but any quite strong outside influence can smash the form and doom its content to decay.
And after such a tragedy has occurred, if it is not followed by immediate regeneration,
the ethnos is converted into an amorphous population, a component of the geobiocoenosis.
And only a new burst of ethnogenesis will bring it out of the blind alley, force it to mix
with neighbors, and proclaim a new ethnic dominant. But then that will already be a new
ethnos.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Creation or life?</strong></font> </i>At first glance
this harsh conclusion strikes one as pessimistic, but only at first glance. Do people need
an eternity of vegetation bereft of God, of inspiration, bereft of life and love and tears <a name="ebe4text16"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note16">[+16]</a>? </p>

<p>Is not a capacity for creation the best quality of people? But it involves
unrecuperated expenditure of the vital energy of the human organism. And if it is a matter
of a system of a higher order, an ethnos, then the pattern in it is the same. Victory over
a strong enemy in a war of liberation or conquest carries off many heroes and their genes.
But is it worth preferring such a sacrifice to shameful slavery? Transformation of the
landscape, the opening up of new lands (and in our time of planets), exhausting work in a
laboratory or a library, not out of duty but for the love of it, tear people from their
families or in general prevent them from building one. But we esteem the names of Columbus
and Magellan, Przhevalsky and Livingstone, of the mathematicians Evariste Galois and Henri
Poincare, of the historian Thierry and the scientist Mendeleev, who burnt themselves out
in work. And artists? Rembrandt and Van Gogh, Andrei Rublev and Mikhail Vrubel. And the
poets, and the composers; and the heroes who fought for their fatherland need not even be
listed, since everybody knows such examples. Many of them left no trace in the gene fund
but their sacrifice erected an edifice of culture that now inspires posterity.</p>

<p>But some people like these had families and their children did not display the talents
of their parents. But does that contradict my conclusion? Let us see.</p>

<p>Capability, in itself, is hardly everything. A fuse is needed for great achievements
that pushes people to self-sacrificing service to an ideal, real or imaginary. This fuse
can be treated precisely as a characteristic (probably recessive, because it is not always
inherited). If a person of the described bent had a hundred children, one could probably
calculate the percentage and so the probability of this characteristic being passed on.
But alas, methods of investigation suitable for peas and flies are not applicable to man.
But history has material at its disposal that generalizes the characteristics of the
activity of various ethnoi in various, rigorously dated epochs. Ethnic history and
analysis of various ethnogeneses allow us to establish the following mutual dependency:
the intensity of ethnogenesis is inversely proportional to the ethnic system's length of
existence, which nevertheless cannot exist indefinitely.</p>

<p>(1) The monotony of a depressing existence lowers people's vital tonus so much that an
inclination toward narcotics and sexual aberrations arises, in order to fill the psychic
vacuum being formed. And that always weakens an ethnos as a system. (2) Having eliminated
extremal genotypes, an ethnos is simplified through the reduction of diversity, and that
in turn lowers the resistance of the ethnic collective as a whole. In quiet conditions
that is imperceptible, but when there are clashes with the biological medium, mainly with
neighbors, the absence of active, specialized, and sacrificial elements is very painfully
felt. It is hardly right to consider it a conscious process as S.M. Shirokogorov did, in
suggesting that an ethnos tended to 'intellectual leveling and reduction to a common level
of individuals who put themselves first, being guided by an awareness (or instinct) of
self-preservation'. <a name="ebe4text17"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note17">[+17]</a></p>


<p>No ethnos takes conscious decisions about eliminating thinking and valiant people, but
they perish by the logic of events uncontrolled by the will of their participants. Such
was in imperial Rome when, during soldiers' mutinies, the most disciplined centurions
became their victims, after which the legionaries were easily broken by the barbarians;
and in Byzantium where the population refused to man the walls in 1204 and 1453 and defend
their homes, leaving the courageous defenders to die without help; in China, in the
twelfth and thirteenth centuries, where the population and the government surrendered to
the Jurchen and the Mongols, and so on. But it was so only in epochs of decline when the
logic of historical events coincided along the vector with biological degeneration and
social crises. And because each ethnogenesis finishes with the death of the system, the
teleological principle seems absurd. Can people strive for their own terrible end? It can
only courageously recognize its inevitability.</p>

<p>So, neither Darwinist nor anti-Darwinist, nor the new synthetic conceptions of
evolution are suitable as an explanation of ethnogenesis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The views of S.L Korzinsky.</strong></font> </i>Yet
there is a conception suitable for my subject with, of course, corrections and a purging
of the preconceptions of individual theses.</p>

<p>In 1899 Korzhinsky, a well-known Russian scientist, published a book in St. Petersburg <i>Heterogenesis
and Evolution. </i>In his view, the struggle for existence and natural selection were
factors limiting the formation of new forms and putting a stop to the accumulation of
variations, since they promoted the survival of average types, i.e. maintained the <i>status
quo. </i>The appearance of new forms came about through rare 'leap variations' in some
geographical region or other. The process of evolution led to the formation of a sex
barrier (uncrossability) between the new race and its progenitors and the rise of new
heterogeneous variations.</p>

<p>The appearance of a new geographical race was pictured as follows: </p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="smallquote">Among the progeny coming from normal members of some species or race
  and developing in one and the same conditions, separate individuals unexpectedly appear
  deviating more or less from the others and from their parents. These deviations are
  sometimes quite significant and are expressed in a whole number of characteristics, but
  are frequently restricted to a few or even some one difference. But it is noteworthy that
  these characteristics have great constancy and are invariably passed on from generation to
  generation. Thus, a new race arises, as fast and constant as those that have existed since
  time immemorial. <a name="ebe4text18"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note18">[+18]</a></p>
</blockquote>

<p>Zavadsky is seemingly right when he notes that Korzhinsky's hypothesis relates to race
or species formation, but by-passes the problem of expediency, and does not ask what is
the link between species formation and adaptation genesis. The hypothesis consequently has
no connection with evolution understood as the formation of good, expedient
characteristics. <a name="ebe4text19"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note19">[+19]</a></p>



<p>Without taking it on myself to judge how far Korzhinsky's conclusions are correct in
regard to the formation of species, they are applicable as a whole when one is speaking of
ethnogenesis, a process of several orders lower. The processes of the formation of ethnoi
are not evolutionary ones, and it is in this that ethnogenesis differs from
anthropogenesis.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Excess and inertia in ethnogenesis.</strong></font> </i>The
conception of heterogenesis removes almost all the perplexities about the character of
ethnogenetic processes. Natural selection stabilizes an ethnic system, which leads to its
inevitable simplification. That in turn calls for recognition of the conception of excess,
i.e. of the stimuli (singular mutations) that arise from time to time and upset the
natural course of the changes of energy connected with the origin of an ethnos, in order
to explain the phenomena observed.</p>

<p>But if the processes described were not offset by others just as powerful, but of
opposite sign, new ethnoi would not arise. Then mankind would already have been converted,
back in the Palaeohthic, into an amorphous mass of anthropoids similar to each other and
inhabiting one climatic belt. These biped predators would have multiplied extremely slowly
because, like all other animals, they would have been limited by the amount of food. And
they would not have needed intellect because, having attained optimum adaptation to the
natural conditions, they would not have experienced a need for changes. In short they
would all have lived like present persistent isolates.</p>

<p>But in fact there were outbursts of ethnogenesis from time to time entailing an
extension of the area and a reshuffling of many of the elements of the hypersystem called
'mankind'. And, as I showed above, these outbursts are inexplicable by social development
because they are not oriented to progress at all and so seldom coincide with changes of
formations that the coincidences should be considered chance ones. That means it is
necessary to return to the conception of the biological evolution of <i>Homo sapiens. </i>It
is accepted to consider that, after the forming of a genuinely human society in the Upper
Paleolithic, 'selection as a species-forming force proved surmounted' and 'by comparison
with the high development of speech and thinking <i>Homo sapiens' </i>other features were
not of decisive importance, although they were not, of course, indifferent'. <a name="ebe4text20"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note20">[+20]</a> The last reservation is sufficient.</p>

<p>For an excess to arise that does not alter man's physiology and anatomy, but only
deforms the stereotype of behaviour, it need not be strong. On the contrary, only a weak
excess leaves the background unaffected (whether geographical, physiological, or social)
on which the outlines of the new psychological attitude stand out clearly. And the
stimulus of this excess or push can only be the X-factor mentioned more than once above.</p>

<p><font color="#FF0000"><strong><i>Until an answer is found.</i> </strong></font>In
trying to find t non-contradictory explanation of the essence of ethnic phenomena, I have
turned to various sciences and everywhere obtained an answer of sorts, but always not
exhaustive. Not that I did not need these answers; quite the contrary, they were necessary
but illuminated certain conditions of ethnogenesis and not its true cause, which according
to the conditions of my problem, should bc invariant, i.e. always be present and
unequivocally affect the phenomena. Let me explain.</p>

<p>Racial or interracial shift of ethnoi through exogamy or assimilation sometimes
generates a new ethnos, sometimes a throwback to the initial forms, and sometimes leads to
degeneration of the population to its complete dying out. Obviously there is an
unaccountable characteristic in these processes that radically alters the results.</p>

<p>The isolation realized through endogamy often preserves ethnoi, but sometimes so
weakens them that they lose the capacity to resist both the natural and the ethnic
environment. Then the ethnos disappears, being displaced or destroyed by neighbors.</p>

<p>Adaptation to conditions of terrain of various character sometimes leads to ethnic
degeneration, but sometimes does not. Even in different climatic zones an ethnos may
remain monolithic, at a given level of mosaic development, of course.</p>

<p>Similarity of a territory's conditions, into which two or three ethnoi are brought by
migration, on the contrary, sometimes entails mutual assimilation, but sometimes the
ethnoi coexist without merging. The cause, here, is clearly not the nature of the region
but something in the ethnoi themselves, that still has to be discovered and described.</p>

<p>A combination of two or more reliefs or terrains is an obligatory condition for the
beginning of a local ethnogenetic process. But it is not enough. Ethnoi do not always
arise in such conditions, which means we must look for an additional factor.</p>

<p>The spread of one type of culture, for example, a religious system, sometimes leads to
the merging of ethnoi, but sometimes does have the least influence on the independence of
the ethnic development of new beliefs. Similarity of material culture may equally either
bring peoples together or push them into competition and rivalry, or have nothing to do
with their relationships. The same needs to be said of the division of cultural types.
When a new sect or doctrine appears, its devotees sometimes hive off into a special
ethnos, but sometimes remain in the old one, maintaining their convictions. Intolerance is
not characteristic of all ages and peoples.</p>

<p>Similarity of social conditions may attend the assimilation of ethnoi but not
necessarily so. It also often happens that some of the people in an ethnos live according
to the accustomed conditions of gentile society, some under feudalism, while a certain
active group practices capitalist relations. That phenomenon is known and is called a
multi-sectoral economy.</p>

<p>Does the global historical process lead, perhaps, to the formation of huge ethnic
entities? Sometimes it does, but sometimes the ethnos becomes divided into two or three
parts from which new ethnoi arise capable either of migrating or coexisting in one
territory. Again, it is possible, but not necessary.</p>

<p>But since all the aspects enumerated above still have significance for the way the
ethnogenesis of one ethnos or another proceeds, it would seemingly be correct to consider
them parameters rather than factors, because only by excluding local variations can we
discover the true X-factor, the same for all ethnogeneses, so that having found it we can
solve all the enumerated puzzles.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Ethnogenesis and energy.</strong></font> </i>The
common features of an ethnos as such, i.e. any ethnos, are the following: (1) its opposing
of itself to all others, and consequently self-assertion; (2) a mosaic development or
structure, or rather an infinite divisibility cemented by systems connections; (3) a
uniform process of development from the starting moment, through an acme phase, to
dispersal or conversion into a relict. Since I have established that an ethnos is not 'an
amorphous state', and not 'a social category', and not 'a complex of community of
language, economy, territory and psychological character', but a phase in the process of
ethnogenesis, the key to solving the problem lies precisely in the third obligatory
feature.</p>

<p>Let me draw the conclusion that suggests itself. Both for the starting moment and for
achieving the acme, and equally for regeneration, a capacity is required for super
stresses and tensions in the rising population, which are displayed either in the
transformation of nature or in migrations, etc., that is to say in the sought after
X-factor. Almost all the ethnoi known to me are grouped together in unique constructions,
superethnic entities. The spread of ethnoi is linked with the place where they arise, with
migrations, with victories and defeats in the struggle with natural calamities and
neighbors, but ordinary tensions are not sufficient for them not to perish. Any aggregate
state of the medium is inert, and a supplementary expenditure of energy is called for to
disturb it, similar to the latent heat of melting or evaporation. But after a super effort
has been made, an inertial process begins that is dampened only through the resistance of
the medium.</p>

<p>Two ethnic 'states' are known to me, the homeostatic, in which the life cycle is
repeated in the generations, and the dynamic, in which the ethnos passes through the
phases of development named above, with homeostasis as the limit. Movement is observed in
both cases, but in the first it can be metaphorically called rotary, and in the second
oscillating, its tensity being measured by its amplitude. Social progress is onward
movement, but we have already shown its difference from ethnogenesis.</p>

<p>In answer to 'What moves?', I say - the ethnic system, which is a component of Earth's
biosphere. To 'Where does it move?', I answer - nowhere, because the concepts 'ahead' or
'back' are inapplicable to oscillatory motion. The question 'Can we find a mathematical
expression for ethnogenesis that would facilitate analysis?' cannot be answered in one
word. Let me try and clarify this in detail.</p>

<p>When we pose any task in connection with ethnological problems, we experience the same
difficulties as when one tries to solve some not clearly formulated technical problem by
means of modern computers. Numerical methods are inapplicable in both. But in both a
solution can be obtained by employing known methods of modeling. A model of the process is
created that reflects the aggregate of our views on it, and it is corrected by reliable
facts. Then the model is employed both to identify the remaining set of facts and events,
and to forecast the characteristics of the future state of the process or one not known to
us in the past. Each solution that we recognize as correct refines and develops the model
on the basis of a heuristic evaluation and as a result of confirming by new, purposively
found factors (a plausible solution being known).</p>

<p>And, finally, we know that all ethnoi now existing were created relatively recently;
rare relicts survive from old ones, but not one remains from the primeval ones. That
indicates that ethnogenesis is a constantly on-going process, like other phenomena of
nature, although correlated with sociogenesis, which gives rise to systems of a rigid
type.</p>

<p>In order to create or construct a system of one type or another it is necessary to do
work, i.e. to expend corresponding energy. This energy is not electromagnetic, of course,
or thermal, or gravitational, or just mechanical. But I have already shown that
anthropogenic successions, dampened through the environment's resistance, are relatively
rare but powerful impulses, explosions of energy, capable of performing work. <a name="ebe4text21"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note21">[+21]</a></p>


<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The discreteness of ethnic history.</strong></font> </i>The
discreteness of certain processes of history had already been noticed by the historians of
antiquity. Ssu-ma Ch'ien formulated this law quite laconically: 'The road of the three
kingdoms is ended and has begun agitin'. <a name="ebe4text22"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note22">[+22]</a> This idea
is present in many historians from ibn Khaldun and Vico to Spengler and Arnold Toynbee. It
is untrue when applied to the social history of mankind, and inexact when the history of
separate countries is being worked out, but is acceptable for studying the processes of
ethnogenesis, with substantial corrections of course.</p>

<p>(1) The 'end' does not always mark the appearance of a 'beginning'. Ethnoi and
superethnic cultures not only arise when the preceding cycle of development ends, but
sometimes after a considerable interval of time after its end. The striving to see a
strict rhythm is not supported by the facts. Thus the Byzantine ethnos arose in the epoch
of the flourishing of the Helleno-Roman, and they co-existed for several centuries. The
Muslim superethnos forced the Byzantine and Germano-Roman to make way for it while at the
same time swallowing up the Central Persian (Sassanian Iran and Sogdiana). And between the
Hunni and the Turks, and the Turks and the Mongols, lay centuries of troubled times when
the steppe was peopled by relict ethnoi. It is seemingly a more complicated matter, or
rather the cause of ethnogenesis does not lie in the rhythm of ethnoi's history.</p>

<p>(2) The ordinary division of the process into three stages (rise, flowering, and
decline) does not answer the simple question 'the rise and fall of what?'. The level of
life fluctuates independently of these stages; flourishing and culture do not coincide
with a favourable economic or political situation, and the power of the state is not
always an indicator of an easy life. Under Napoleon, for example, the French were
distressed - there was no sugar, coffee, or woolen fabrics. In short, qualitative
evaluations are inevitably subjective and cannot be taken into account in the description
of natural phenomena, to which ethnogenesis belongs.</p>

<p>Finally, where is the boundary between the social and the biological in both the
individual person and the social collective? On the one hand, it lies within the human
body, and on the other, far beyond it. Anatomy, physiology, reflexology, the genetic code
are all not social but biological, biochemical, and even biophysical. The character of the
development of state relations, on the contrary, and of political demands and
requirements, and of ethnical and aesthetic ideals are not reducible to biological and
geographical factors, but are the fruit of social development. Combining study of these
two lines of development makes it possible to re-create the history of separate ethnoi;
and when the history of the terrain and history of culture are added to that, we will have
ethnic history.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Where, then, is the X-factor?</strong></font> </i>Now,
when I have described the phenomenon of ethnogenesis in various aspects, I can pose the
question of what is the cause of the rise of these inertial processes. Since no action can
occur without the application of forces, we must evidently look for a form of energy that
acts directly on man's mind, and an effect of this energy that can be found in the human
psyche. It must be an impulse strong enough to overcome the instinct of personal and even
species self-preservation inherent in any organism, i.e. sacrifice that extends even to
one's posterity, which is not observed in any animal species. But then there are no ethnoi
among animals. Their communities lack the social form of the motion of matter and
self-developing institutions. Consequently, the X-factor interesting me lies in the sphere
of human psychology.</p>

<p>When searching for the factor that generates and destroys ethnoi one must remember that
it operates on the background (1) of a changing geographical environment, (2) of
evolutionary processes of social development, (3) of historical <i>peripeteiae</i>, and
(4) of growth or decline of culture. And the study of the background subjects enumerated
also includes, of course, ethnogenesis. Consequently, it is not the sum total of the
sciences but their system, determined by the problem set, that is the key to answering any
problem posed, i.e. to a scientific synthesis. That is why I have prefaced the exposition
of my main subject by a long description of the phenomenon of ethnos and its interaction
with nature, society, and the traditions of culture inherited from the distant past.</p>

<p>It will be quite obvious that all attempts to discover this X-factor by analyzing the
behaviour of separate people are doomed to failure. First of all, we can never distinguish
the partial and accidental in single cases from the general-species and law-governed. But
as soon as the statistical law of large numbers comes into force, small deviations from
the regular mutually cancel each other out and systems of connections are discovered with
acceptable plus or minus deviations that in no way distort the picture. But the separate
examples possess the clarity of representation necessary for understanding the principle,
and I shall therefore not scorn them. But it must be remembered that however necessary
they are as illustrations they are never a substitute for the meaning.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p><i><font color="#FF0000"><strong>Clio vs Kronos.</strong></font> </i>Now let us talk
about history, because there is something to say. Not only in the skeptical nineteenth
century did the profane call history an idle pastime, entertaining reading, the whim of
rich idlers, a means of propaganda or even a 'policy turned to the past'. But there are
other views about history.</p>

<p>Not so long ago the astronomer Kozyrev made an attempt to understand history as a
function of time that allegedly exuded in its course the energy needed for great and small
achievements. But that conception, too, is bankrupt, because the historical processes that
actually occur in time are entropic and inertial and consequently arise not thanks to
Kronos, who devoured his own children, but in spite of him.</p>

<p>But if that is so, then the science of history is a struggle with time, which the
Hellenes personified in the terrible god Kronos who castrated his own father Uranus and
was overthrown by the lord of lightning Zeus. But lightning is energy, in my language
anti-entropic impulses that with their rise disrupt the processes of death, the entropy of
the Universe. Force, the cause provoking acceleration, saves Cosmos from conversion into
Chaos, and the name of this force is Life.</p>

<p>But in the eternal war of the protogenic elements, the servants of Kronos, the
hundred-handed giants or <i>asura </i>(Sanskrit), lose nothing because they have nothing
to lose. Kronos changed their appearance every second, and so deprived them of personal
qualities and properties. But the paladins of Cosmos, the ordered Universe, by their
nature acquired forms, and consequently also a personality, in each case unique and
inimitable. And in the struggle with Chaos they meet their death - the separation of space
from time. <a name="ebe4text23"></a><a href="ebe4.htm#ebe4note23">[+23]</a></p>


<p>For those that die, be they microbes or baobabs, men or embryos, time disappears, but
all organisms of the biosphere are connected with one another, and that means they know
one another. And the death of one is a loss for many, because it is a victory of Kronos,
the known enemy of life. To be reconciled to the loss is a surrender of position, and
against Death stands Memory, the barrier to entropy of no longer being but consciousness.
And it is memory that divides time into past, present, and future, of which only the past
is real.</p>

<p>The present, in fact, is only a moment, instantaneously becoming the past. There is no
future, because acts that determine any consequences are not completed, and it is not
known whether they will be completed. The future can only be calculated statistically,
with an assumption that deprives the calculations of practical value. But the past exists;
and everything that exists is the past, because any achievement then and there becomes
past. That is why the science of history studies the sole reality, which exists outside us
and despite us.</p>

<p>And not only the profane say that knowledge of the past is useless for our practical
life. In antiquity they went to fortune-tellers and astrologers to divine the future. And
the latter divined, sometimes amazingly correctly. But how did the soothsayers achieve
success? By studying the past, by checking possible variants, and refining forecasts,
because the number of variants in a given situation was always limited. Thus a good chess
player calculates a game many moves ahead because he spares no pains to study hundreds of
games played long before he was born. The history of chess play helps him build the most
probable and therefore in practice the truest forecasts, and then to win in tournaments
and matches. The knowledge of the past is incarnated in the present, i.e. in success.</p>

<p>Every experiment of a physicist or chemist, observation of a geologist or botanist,
communication of a theorist, or the calculations of an economist, when written down, are
converted into historical sources, i.e. a fixing of the past that enables us, with skilful
use, to find the optimum variants of behavior for achieving ends that lie in the illusive
future. </p>

<p>Finally, is understanding of oneself and of one's place in the world really only a
means of making money? No, it is the goal for many people worthy of respect! Surely,
gratitude to the ancestors who built the town in which we live, who discovered new lands
to which we now travel without fuss, who painted pictures we feast our eyes on, and who
wrote books from which we learn, is the duty of everyone who has not lost human feelings.
Is admiration of the heroes of the past who gave their lives for the sake of their
posterity really a prejudice? No! Thanks to history!</p>

<p>But history is a search for truth, because the information of ancient sources is
bespattered with lies, like fetid mud. The past ceases to be real when it is replaced by
fabrications and figments of the imagination, or distorted by incomplete transmission, or
burdened with the unnecessary tinsel and trimmings of senseless details. The father of
lies whispers into the ears of credulous ignoramuses that there is no truth in history but
only personal perceptions, that its phenomena are not a chain of causally connected events
but a senseless kaleidoscope it is impossible to remember, that texts should be understood
literally as if the chronicler had written them not for contemporaries but for posterity,
and finally that all migrations of ethnoi, and their rises and falls, their fame and
death, are like the play of moonlight on the ripples of a lake. But if that is so, then
there is no need to study history, and the past, lost from memory, becomes nothing, and
Chaos takes the place of Cosmos.</p>

<p>At the end of the eighth century A.D., in Tibet, Buddhist preachers, adherents of the
Mahayana, taught that the world was an illusion, salvation submergence in Nirvana, and the
way to Nirvana the avoidance of either bad or good deeds, because 'black clouds and white
clouds equally hide the sun from us'. To that the Tibetan shen, a Bonze or Buddhist
priest, appealing to the people, said: 'Do not listen to the twaddle of the Mahayanists:
the heart will tell you where black is and where white'. Obviousness and intuition lie on
the boundary of science and art. That is why history has its own muse, Clio.</p>

<p>No, it is not a matter of the right to groundless, almost always absurd statements,
supposedly suggested by intuition or to obvious ones, like the rotation of the Sun around
the Earth. Deceit is also possible when it rests on self-deceit. Clio helps her devotees
in another, much more important matter, viz., to find the proofs of correct theses, to
bring out mistakes in the collection of initial data, and to spot breaches of logical
constructions. All that is ostensibly simple, but in fact each, even tiny approximation to
the truth is a feat.</p>

<p>But Clio not only knows how to preserve the remnants of the past, covered by the dust
of Time and blanketed by the ashes of the Lie. She can deprive these predators of their
prey and does so under our very eyes and by our hands. The ruins of Troy were found, the
Tower of Babel excavated, the treasures of Tutankhamen saved, the hieroglyphs of the Mayas
read, the forgery of tile chronicles made by Ivan the Terrible discovered, and the black
legend of the Mongols lifted. The list of the resurrections, even though not of
personalities, but of their great deeds, could be endlessly continued, because great and
small discoveries are being made, now here, now there.</p>

<p>Isn't that a victory over Kronos? Isn't it the resurrection of ancestor ethnoi?</p>

<p>Now I can pose the main question: 'Why do ethnoi arise and why is their end
inevitable?'</p>
