<h3></b><a name="sik3para08">8. The Loss of a Dream
(1218-1259)</a></h3>
<h4>Advantages and Disadvantages of the View from the Barrow</h4>
<p>As we have seen, each degree of approximation affords the
opportunity to view the subject in a new way, but losses grow in direct
proportion to gains. Thus, looking at the object with a bird's eye view, or an
approximation of 2.5, we were able to disclose the geographic location of the
non-existent Christian Kingdom in Asia and even the period in which the events
which gave rise to the medieval legend took place. But with this approach we are
in no position to establish the details of events, still less their causes:
economic, social, political and ideological. The latter, least weighty in the
actual course of history, are of value as an indicator disclosing deep patterns.
But even the surface description was inadequate, because the polemical
literature of the Nestorians against Confucianism, Buddhism, Taoism, Bon,
shamanism and even Sufism has not survived; it did, of course, exist, it has
just not come down to us.</p>
<p>Therefore, selecting the most important link in the chain of
events, we have looked at it in more detail and, thanks to this, have explained
some patterns in the &quot;force of circumstances&quot; or, more academically,
the logic of events. But the global perspective has been lost. In the haze on
the horizon objects are depicted indistinctly; that is as it should be. If the
history of Europe, Byzantium, the Caliphate and China are depicted at the same
approximation, our Kara-Khitan, Naiman and even the Mongols will drown in a sea
of facts, extremely interesting, but remote from our subject as the silhouette
of a camel seen against the sky where it touches the earth; of course, this is
only for our eyes. But it is impossible to get by without a perspective, for the
link between events is felt throughout the whole of the Eurasian continent and
North Africa. So we shall try to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{170} </font></b>find
a way out, depicting remote but important phenomena as outlines or,
metaphorically speaking, silhouettes.</p>
<p>During the 108 years from the break up of the nomad unity
conventionally known as Zubu to the great kuriltai on the Onon where the new
nomad empire had been proclaimed, Europe and Hither Asia had changed beyond
recognition. The First Crusade had led to the formation of the feudal Kingdom of
Jerusalem; the Second summoned a genius, like a spirit from the abyss, the Kurd
Yusuf son of Eyub, Sala ad-Din, who conquered Jerusalem and united Egypt and
Syria, thus creating a barrier which even the kings and knights of the Third
Crusade were unable to pass.</p>
<p>Enmity between Franks and Greeks grew, not daily, but hourly.
The devastation of Epirus and Thessaloniki by the Sicilian Normans, the
robberies by the Crusaders in friendly Thrace, the insults by Italian merchants
in Constantinople itself evoked justified dissatisfaction among the Greeks. The
Greeks&quot; refusal to help the Crusaders with provisions, the obligation,
imposed by the Byzantine Emperor on the leaders of the crusading levy, to take
the oath of vassals, the enlisting of Pechenegs and Turks against the European
forces of Gottfried of Bouillon and Frederick Barbarossa perturbed the whole
Catholic world. The Crusaders&quot; failure was blamed on the Greeks and
Geoffroy de Villehardouin wrote that: &quot;The land over the sea (Palestine)
was in the clutches of Persida and Byzantium.&quot; Both cultural regions were
to him equally hostile, despite the fact that one of them was Christian. The
ethnic and cultural gulf was greater than the similarity of dogma. Finally,
blood flowed; in 1182 the Greek population of the coastal towns organised a
massacre of the factories of the Italian merchants and a merciless slaughter.
The reply to this, not thought out, but emotional, based not on political
consideration, but on the &quot;force of circumstances&quot; became the Fourth
Crusade. Only thanks to the accumulated hatred did Doge Dandolo succeed with his
hellish idea.</p>
<p>There was no smooth transition from the twelfth to the
thirteenth century. A fierce spasm in East and West set a sharp border between
the two periods, changing in the course of some three years the whole
disposition of forces in the Eurasian continent. This border passed through
1204.</p>
<p>In the twelfth century Constantinople was the Paris of the
Middle Ages. It was &quot;famous for its wealth&quot;, writes Eudes de Deuil,
&quot;but in reality its treasures exceed their fame&quot;. Robert de Clary
asserted <b><font COLOR="#943634">{171} </font></b>that
&quot;two thirds of the world's wealth is in Constantinople and one third is
scattered throughout the world&quot;.  <a name="sik3text65"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note65">[+65]</a>
Then, on 12 April 1204 Constantinople was taken by assault and the Byzantine
Empire ceased to exist.</p>
<p>The crusading knights justified themselves as having done
something pleasing to God, for the Greeks were schismatics, heretics, perhaps
worse than the Muslim and the heathen.  <a name="sik3text66"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note66">[+66]</a>
The cultural and historical principle prevailed over the question of dogma, and
the Catholics, unable to conquer Islam, declared war on Orthodoxy. Pope Innocent
III, who at first had been opposed to the war against Christians and had
threatened the Crusaders with excommunication, in 1207 put himself (or was
obliged to put himself) at the head of a new drive to the east.  <a name="sik3text67"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note67">[+67]</a>
That year Catholic diplomacy managed to conclude an agreement with the Bulgarian
king, which saved the Latin Empire, and the Pope demanded that Poland, the
Order, Sweden, and Norway stop taking iron into Rus`. The Russian princes&quot;
political shortsightedness ensured the success of Catholic penetration. In 1212
Bishop Albert of Livonia concluded an alliance with the Polotsk prince against
the Ests, then married his brother to the Pskov prince's daughter, after which,
in 1228, a pro-German boyar group appeared in Pskov.  <a name="sik3text68"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note68">[+68]</a>
In 1231 Pope Gregory IX proposed to Yurii II, Prince of Vladimir and All Rus`,
that he accept Catholicism.  <a name="sik3text69"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note69">[+69]</a>
In reply, Yurii sent the Dominican monks out of Rus`; then the forces of the
Swedes, Germans and Lithuanians began their advance on Novgorod and Pskov. At
this time the Lithuanians were seeking an alliance with the papacy to muzzle the
Livonian Knights.</p>
<p>In 1239, when relations between the Latins and Bulgaria had
deteriorated, Narjot de Toucy concluded an alliance, sealed by <b><font COLOR="#943634">{172}
</font></b>marriage, with one of the Polovtsy khans in order to
threaten Bulgaria and Rus` with a pincer movement. K. Marx considered this
&quot;the last word of stupidity by the crusader-knights&quot;,  <a name="sik3text70"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note70">[+70]</a>
and he was right, even though educated Europeans in the thirteenth century
thought the conquest of Rus` would be no more difficult than the subjection of
Prussia.  <a name="sik3text71"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note71">[+71]</a>
Essentially, the war which started in 1204 was one of the first aimed at
acquiring colonies; the religious colouring corresponded to the spirit of the
times.</p>
<p>At the same time, in the Mongol steppes, Chinggiskhan was
victorious and conquered two of the strongest and most cultivated of khanates:
the Kerait in 1203 and the Naiman in 1204. But Chinggiskhan dealt with the
vanquished Kerait and Naiman much more humanely than Baldwin of Flanders did
with the Greeks. The Kerait and Naiman increased the strength of the Mongol
army, the royal princess Sorqoqtani  <a name="sik3text72"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note72">[+72]</a>
married the khan's favourite son, Tolui, and kept her Nestorian church by her
with its clergy and property.  <a name="sik3text73"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note73">[+73]</a>
Her children, Mongke, Kubilai, Hulegu and Arik-Boke, were brought up in the
spirit of respect for the Christian religion, although, according to the
Mongolian Yasa, they could not be baptised.  <a name="sik3text74"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note74">[+74]</a>
There was no benefit to Orthodoxy in the triumph of Nestorianism since the nomad
clergy still recalled in the thirteenth century that the founder of their faith
had received the martyr's crown from the Greeks.  <a name="sik3text75"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note75">[+75]</a></p>
<p>But the victory of Nestorianism perhaps threatened the
Muslims with even more troubles. It was, of course, the Christian Uighurs who
had set the Kara-Khitan and Naiman on the Muslim population <b><font COLOR="#943634">{173}
</font></b>of Central Asia and, as soon as they were convinced
that the gurkhans restricted themselves to the exaction of tribute, withdrew
their support. The Chinese Confucians evoked no sympathy among the Nestorians;
they had two hundred years earlier driven the Christian faith from China. Now,
when they formed a majority in the army and the bureaucracy, when the royal
princes and many Mongol noyans were linked with them by ties of marriage or
friendship and when their merchants had obtained luxurious privileges and income
merely because they had not obliged the Mongols to exterminate them, now the
Nestorians considered the time was ripe to realise, with the help of a heathen
khan, that very dream of an eastern Christian kingdom which had not so far been
achieved. Therefore, they became fervent adherents of Chinggiskhan, true
defenders of his authority.</p>
<p>For his part, Chinggiskhan knew how to value their
faithfulness and diligence. It is difficult to say whether he knew of the hopes
they placed on him. Probably he knew but did not burden himself with speculation
about it. He had enough cares without that. The Jurchen in China were manly and
obstinate, like the Mongols themselves, and war in the east continued, though
without due energy, throughout his reign. His western neighbour, the
Khwarizmshah Muhammed, had a regular army twice the size of Chinggiskhan's whole
force. The attitude of the Khwarizm people to the Mongols was openly hostile and
they held the initiative to unleash war. The Mongols displayed enviable
restraint. They failed to react to the uncalled for attack on their troops on
the Irgiz in 1216. After the pillaging and destruction of a caravan in Otrar in
1218 Chinggiskhan attempted to resolve the conflict by diplomatic means, but
when the Khwarizmshah ordered the Mongol emissary to be killed war became
unavoidable. For the first time since the First Turkish Kaganate, a united Great
Steppe arose before the Near East.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Consequences and Causes</h4>
<p>The chronological period in which the problem we have posed
occurs comes to an end with the tragedy of 1218, or more precisely, with the
death of Kuchlug. But, as we devoted an introductory chapter, on the
preconditions of the original moment, to exposing the events directly concerning
us, so, for the sake of clarity, we have to trace the contours of a new period,
the greatness and dissolution <b><font COLOR="#943634">{174} </font></b>of
the Mongol ulus, because the main sources for our theme were written in the
thirteenth century. And the reliability of information in the sources depends
not only on the material their authors used, but also on the circumstances in
which they worked and the reader they were addressing.</p>
<p>Second, a still more important circumstance compels us to
devote space to the consequences of the events described. Knowing the causes, it
is not difficult to consider their consequences, but, knowing the consequences,
by the reverse mental process we may recover the causes giving rise to them.
Therefore, the more we extend our aim in space and time, the easier we shall
achieve it In the course of the hundred years from the appearance of the legend
of the priest-king John to complete disillusion with the hopes of an eastern
Christianity, changes took place in Europe which are directly related to our
subject. Let us try to see them at a glance, leaving out, of course, details and
minor points which can only hinder us here. A special place and its own method
of analysis and synthesis will be found for them, but on a different scale.</p>
<p>Equally, we shall leave aside the problem of the
disappearance of Nestorianism in Asia, since it is so complex that it deserves a
special investigation of no less a size than that we have undertaken. You cannot
write everything in one book, but you should have a lot in your field of vision.
This is the practical value of the &quot;panoramic method&quot; we have proposed
and applied in this work. So, let us begin with a historical panorama.</p>
<p>In 1211 the Mongols took the Jurchen frontier fortress of Wu-sha
and thus declared that they would wage war on the Jurchen. The first round in
the war ended in 1215 with the capture of Beijing and the conclusion of an
armistice, which was broken the following year since the Mongol khan's proposals
were unacceptable to the Jurchen. Chinggiskhan demanded that all the lands north
of the Huang He be ceded and that the Jurchen ruler should renounce the title of
emperor, in other words, his independence.</p>
<p>The war between the Jurchen and the Mongols was extremely
bloody. Thus, at the fall of Beijing &quot;a great multitude of officials and
inhabitants perished&quot;.  <a name="sik3text76"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note76">[+76]</a>
In order not to fall into enemy hands, many women flung themselves from the town
walls and were crushed to death. The heart-rending pictures which impressed the
imagination <b><font COLOR="#943634">{175} </font></b>of
Chinese historians gave them the grounds to depict the Mongols as monstrous
exterminators and Chinggiskhan as a fiend. However we must look at the subject
from two sides. The war with the Jurchen had not been started, but continued by
the Mongols. Its first period, 1135-47, began with the killing of the Jurchen
spy and ended with the victory of the Mongols who had defended their nomadic
grazing grounds from Jurchen aggression. The second period, constantly
forgotten, began in the year of Chinggiskhan's birth, 1161/2, and continued to
1189. Meng Hong,  <a name="sik3text77"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note77">[+77]</a>
a learned and intelligent Chinese, described it brilliantly. &quot;The head of
the Jin exclaimed with alarm: &quot;The Tatars will unfailingly be a cause of
disturbance to our kingdom!&quot; Therefore, he gave orders for an immediate
attack to be mounted against their remote and desert country. Every three years
troops were sent to the north to exterminate and plunder; this was called
&quot;the reduction of slaves and extermination of people&quot;. Even now they
remember in China that for twenty years before this, in Shandong and Hebei, what
home had not bought Tatar boys and girls into slavery? These had all been
captured by the troops. Those who at the present time [the thirteenth century -
L.G.] are grandees among the Tatars were then for the most part led off into
captivity... The Tatars fled into Shamo [the desert - L.G.] and vengeance
entered their blood and brain.&quot;  <a name="sik3text78"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note78">[+78]</a>
It were better unsaid! What the Chinese scholar described recalls the hunt for
Indian scalps organised by the Puritans of New England and the Baptists of
Massachusetts, the slave trade of the French and English merchant venturers, the
slaughter of the Patagonians undertaken by the Argentine government, i.e. pages
of history branded as those most shameful for mankind. After such crimes
committed by the Jurchen themselves, the bitterness of the Mongols is to be
explained as a psychological reaction to an external irritant or as a
conditioned reflex: pain comes from the Jurchen, so, one has to destroy the
source of the pain. In such a situation, formed by history, Chinggiskhan's
personal qualities were not significant. He led his people <b><font COLOR="#943634">{176}
</font></b>against their ancient, merciless enemies because his
whole people, the children of the dead and the brothers of those sold into
slavery, wanted it. And had he not done this, he would not have been khan!</p>
<p>Moreover, we must note that the Mongols waged war correctly.
When the Ongut and Khitan, also offended by the Jurchen, proposed peace and help
to Chinggis, he accepted it and these people suffered in no way. Moreover, the
northern Jurchen (in Manchuria) capitulated and were not only granted mercy, but
were included in the Mongol army as a separate corps (tumen). War, of course, is
a terrible thing, but in class society it is unavoidable as the sole means of
resolving contradictions. One may morally condemn whoever started the war; the
Jurchen were guilty of that. But to find fault with the victor who has
transferred the battlefield to his opponent's territory is senseless and
immoral. Here, it seems, not historical perspicacity, but prejudice dominates.</p>
<p>The unification of the steppe by means of war had both
positive and negative consequences. The merchants leading caravans between the
Far and Near East gained, as did the Mongol noyans purchasing luxury fabrics for
their wives. The poor population of the steppes lost, since in wartime the
number of livestock fell and the steppe was impoverished. But as the 110,000
army that had been formed had to be fed, continuous war had to be waged in China
where the soldiers found their own food and booty. After their first defeats the
Jurchen recovered and offered frantic resistance to the Mongols so that the war
continued till 1234 and its successful completion was, to a certain extent, due
to the Southern Song (the truly Chinese empire) attacking the Jurchen in the
rear and tying down forces which were needed to repulse the Mongols. The Jurchen
who continued to resist in the fortresses to the south of the Huang He for the
most part perished.</p>
<p>The conflict between the Mongols and the Khwarizmshah
Muhammed led to war in 1219 which ended in the complete rout of the Khwarizm
forces. Mongol troops penetrated into India, into the Caucasus and into the
south Russian steppes, but they only managed to occupy Central Asia as far as
the Amu Darya; the Khwarizm forces were somewhat restored by Muhammed's son,
Jalal ad-Din, who tried to unite the possessions of the Muslim sultans and emirs
of Hither Asia for the struggle against the Mongol incursions. He had to waste
time and effort, however, on a war with Georgia and as a consequence he lost the
pace of his offensive and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{177} </font></b>this
enabled the Mongols to consolidate in Central Asia. By 1227 the position of the
fronts here had become threateningly tense.</p>
<p>Successful wars in China, Central Asia, Iran and the Polovtsy
steppe allowed the Mongol government to feed the army, but did not save the
country from an economic crisis, because with enormous distances and poor means
of communication it was very difficult to get the booty home. The greater part
was lost on the way and never reached Mongolia, where the lack of textiles and
livestock grew. Therefore, Chinggiskhan seized on a reason for war with the
nearby Tangut which the Tangut king himself provided. He refused Chinggiskhan
the military help against Khwarizm which he should have provided under the
treaty of 1211. Evidently, the Tangut king hoped that Chinggiskhan would suffer
defeat in the war with Khwarizm and the Tangut kingdom would become independent
again without bloodshed. Chinggiskhan, after completing his Central Asian
campaign early in 1225, fell on the Tangut with the troops released and besieged
the town of Etzin-ai (now the ruins of Qaraqoto). During the siege, in August
1227, Chinggiskhan died, but the noyans concealed the khan's death, compelled
the town to surrender and dealt harshly with its population. An enormous booty
in cattle and especially camels saved Mongolia from a severe economic crisis
caused by the military expenditures. This last victory ensured the dominance of
the Mongol Empire in east Central Asia where the Mongols no longer had any
competitors. At one time it was believed that the Mongols completely
exterminated the Tangut and turned the country into a desert, but research on
texts brought from Qaraqoto by P.K. Kozlov has shown that the town of Etzin-ai
existed until 1372 under the Mongol name of Uraqai; it was then taken by the
Chinese and destroyed.  <a name="sik3text79"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note79">[+79]</a></p>
<p>The victory over the Tangut kingdom brought with it the
voluntary submission of Tibet. After the first incursion into Northern Tibet,
when the Mongols seized several monasteries and slaughtered the monks, the
Tibetans proposed that the Mongols should accept from them a tribute in learned
lamas and agreed to allow their young men to enter the ranks of the Mongol army,
evidently in order to lose some surplus population.  <a name="sik3text80"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note80">[+80]</a>
The agreement <b><font COLOR="#943634">{178} </font></b>suited
both sides, since the Mongols needed literate officials and soldiers and the
barren plateaux and mountain ranges did not attract them In Tibet there was no
central authority and anarchy oppressed the fragmented country. The steppe was
an accommodating landscape for the Mongols and they did not wish, and were
unable, to settle outside its limits.</p>
<p>One must note that the nomad is much more closely linked with
his primary setting than the farmer. The latter adapts nature to his needs and
habits, changes the flora on the plots he cultivates and, having a surplus
product, raises domestic animals, i.e. influences the fauna. The farmer always
has a stock of provisions allowing him to make long migrations and create his
accustomed conditions in suitable new locations. The nomad is tied to his
animals adapted to particular conditions which are strictly specialised.
Therefore, although the habitat of the nomad is wide, it can only be replaced by
an analogous one, for example, feather grass by wormwood steppe, but not by
forest, hills or desert. This so reduces the ability of nomad peoples to migrate
that the Mongols, after conquering the Kipchak steppes up to the Ural and
Central Asia to the Amu Darya and the Aral Sea, did not transfer their grazing
grounds there, but restricted themselves to acquiring part of Dzungaria. Even
there, in the foothills of Tarbagatai, the true Mongols mixed with the local
Turkic population whose economy was adapted to seasonal pasturing of livestock
and &quot;vertical nomadism&quot; [i.e. transhumance - tr.], from steppes to
mountains and back. As a result of a secondary adaptation and intermingling, a
new people arose which in course of time became completely distinct from the
true Mongols and acquired the ancient name of Oirat, or the new one of Kalmuk.  <a name="sik3text81"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note81">[+81]</a></p>
<p>It would seem that, based on the principle we have described,
further conquests by the Mongols were quite unnecessary. And in fact Mongolia
was drawn into the subsequent wars not of its own will, but by the logic of
events in world history and a policy in which it could no longer fail to take
part.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">

<h4></b>The Force of Inertia</h4>
<p>Chinggiskhan had four sons (by his first legal wife) entitled
to inherit. The eldest, Jochi, did not get on with his father, attempted to show
mercy to the conquered and early in 1227 was killed by men sent to murder him.
His children, Orda and Batu, received modest portions on the infertile
north-western borderlands of the empire. Orda had Southern Siberia and Batu the
Ural-Caspian steppe with Khwarizm thrown in. The second son, Chagatai, was
&quot;guardian of the Yasa&quot; and received Central Asia as his portion. He
was so stern and severe that Chinggiskhan before he died recommended that not
he, but his third son, Ogedei, should be chosen to rule; he received Western
Mongolia and Dzungaria as his portion. Ogedei was kind, ungifted and inclined to
drink, so he did not seem dangerous to the Mongol military nobility who feared
arbitrary rule by the khan. The fourth son, Tolui, who according to Mongol
custom received his father's lands as his portion, was one of the most gifted
commanders and energetic rulers. He had had his military training in China,
fighting against the best Jurchen commanders, and guided by Sube'etei-ba'atur
who in fifty years of military service never lost a single battle and never
violated the Mongolian Yasa. His close association with Sube'etei assured Tolui
of popularity with the troops. According to Mongol law the kuriltai (a general
meeting of warriors) selected khans; until it was convoked, which required time,
a regency was instituted and Tolui was put at the head of the government.</p>
<p>The kuriltai at which Ogedei was chosen as khan took place in
1229, and while the Mongol forces were withdrawn from their fronts the Jurchen
and Muslim were able to recover and put pressure on the Mongol covering forces.
But from 1230 the Mongols again went onto the offensive, completed the conquest
of the Jurchen in China and, after in 1230 routing Jalal ad-Din, irrupted into
Hither Asia where they overcame all the Muslim rulers except the Caliph of
Baghdad.</p>
<p>In 1235, after the victory over the Jurchen, a kuriltai was
held in the Mongol capital, Karakorum, built by Chinggiskhan, and decided to
carry the war with the Polovtsy, Bolgars and the Russians who were supporting
them, to its conclusion. Troops from all four ulus of the Mongol Empire were
sent on the &quot;Western campaign&quot;. The highest command was held by Batu-khan,
but he was given the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{180} </font></b>best
of the Mongol commanders, Sube'etei, for the actual direction of operations.
Ogedei's son, Guyuk, Chagatai's son, Buri, and Tolui's son, Mongke, commanded
separate corps. Detachments of Central Asian Turks who had been wandering around
with nothing to do after the devastation of Khwarizm were attached to the basic
regular forces. They were not particularly battleworthy, but were of help to the
basic forces.</p>
<p>In 1236 the Mongols crossed the Volga and took the town of
Great Bulgar (near Kazan`). Then Mongke fell on the Polovtsy on the lower
reaches of the Volga and defeated their leader, Bachman, who was hiding from the
Mongols in the Volga-Akhtyubinsk flood plain. Next Mongke conquered the Alans in
the Kuban and reached the Don, driving the remnants of the Polovtsy forces
before him. At the same time Batu with the main force burst into the Ryazan`
principality and took Ryazan`. The Mongols then fell on the Vladimir
principality and burnt Suzdal`. Prince Yurii II ordered his military commanders
to defend the capital and went himself to the north to raise a levy. The Mongols
took Vladimir on 7 February 1238, and on 4 March on the river Sit` routed the
levy raised by Yurii II who himself fell in the battle. After the battle and
after taking Torzhok, the Mongols moved towards Novgorod, but the spring
flooding made them withdraw to the steppe for the summer. On their way the town
of Kozel'sk detained them for seven weeks; the Mongols left not a single living
being in it.</p>
<p>In 1239-40 the Mongols entered Southern Rus` and took
Chernigov and Kiev. The latter suffered particularly badly, because the Kievans
had killed the Mongol envoys. From there the Mongols passed through Volyn` and
Galicia into Poland and at Liegnitz in 1241 routed a levy of Polish and German
knights.</p>
<p>Meanwhle another Mongol force had penetrated into Hungary
through passes in the Carpathians and routed a Hungarian army on the river
Shayava. Then the Mongols took Pesht and, pursuing the Hungarian king, reached
the Adriatic. However, in Moravia the Czechs defeated the Mongols near Olomouc
and compelled one of the Mongol armies to retreat into Hungary to join up with
the main force. Here Batu received news of the death of khan Ogedei and
hurriedly left with his troops through Bulgaria, Wallachia, Moldavia and the
Polovtsy steppes for the east, since the exacerbation of contradictions within
the Mongol Empire demanded his direct intervention: parties had been formed in
the Mongol force <b><font COLOR="#943634">{181} </font></b>itself
between which clashes were unavoidable and which promised brutal death for the
loser.  <a name="sik3text82"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note82">[+82]</a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Party Strife</h4>
<p>The Mongol troops included in their ranks so many conquered
people that they had begun to claim their rights. The basic problem facing
Chinggiskhan at the time of his death was the attitude to the conquered. One
trend was to keep them in subjection by force, a second was to bind them by
kindness. Jochi tried to take the second line and paid for it with his life. In
1240-1 Batu quarrelled with his cousins, Guyuk and Buri, sent them from the army
and complained about them to their fathers. The khan and the guardian of the
Yasa punished their sons by declaring them disgraced, but all the same the
question arose as to who would become khan and who would be executed. Both
competitors, Guyuk and Batu, began to seek support; Chagatai's children joined
Guyuk, and Tolui's children Batu. But the genuine power in the country no longer
belonged to the khans and the royal princes, but to a foreigner, the official
Ye-lu Chu-cai, appointed &quot;head of the great imperial secretariat&quot; by
Ogedei, i.e. chief of the civil administration of conquered China. A Kerait,
Chinkai, who had far less influence, controlled the lands of the west.</p>
<p>Ye-lu Chu-cai was a member of the Khitan royal house which
had been overthrown by the Jurchen. He had been educated in the spirit of
Confucian philosophy and had been an official of the Jurchen government. Going
over to the Mongols, Ye-lu Chu-cai made his career and became one of the closest
advisers of Chinggiskhan who felt a need for cultivated people.</p>
<p>At the end of Chinggiskhan's reign the question was raised at
the kuriltai of what to do with the population of Northern China, now conquered.
The people, frightened of the Mongols, were dispersing among the hills and
forests and forming bands; this was of no benefit to the Mongols. The Mongol
military leaders proposed to slaughter all the Chinese and convert the land into
pasture; but Ye-lu Chu-cai opposed this. He showed, with figures, what taxes
might be <b><font COLOR="#943634">{182} </font></b>collected,
if the people were given the right to live and work. The money tempted the khan,
and the Chinese population was spared.</p>
<p>Ogedei was completely under the influence of his minister
who, in 1229, produced reforms which should have converted the military monarchy
into a bureaucratic one. A judicial reform established legal proceedings, thus
limiting the arbitrary exercise of authority by Mongol officers on civilian
service. A financial reform introduced taxation of the Mongols themselves at a
rate of one per cent. In 1230 Ye-lu Chu-cai said to Ogedei: &quot;The Empire was
conquered on horseback, but it is impossible to run it from horseback.&quot; The
khan listened to this favourably and in 1231 appointed Ye-lu Chu-cai <i>zhongshuling,
</i>i.e. chancellor, and allowed him to pursue his political line. It was
crowned with success. The taxes gave an income which astounded the khan. Ye-lu
Chu-cai obtained the khan's complete confidence and, concentrating in his hands
financial, legal and administrative authority, he became the manager of the
whole internal policy in China. But this system encountered opposition on the
part of the army; the first clash took place in 1233. After a long and arduous
siege Sube'etei took the Jurchen capital of Bianjing (Kaifeng). According to
Mongol law, a town not surrendering before the siege implements had been brought
into use should be cut down to the last man. this fate awaited the inhabitants
of Bianjing, but Ye-lu Chu-cai showed that exterminating the town's inhabitants
would harm the treasury and stated the amount of income which would result by
sparing the inhabitants. Ogedei agreed with him.</p>
<p>With the money obtained from the population that had been
spared, Ye-lu Chu-cai finished the building of Karakorum, the capital of the
empire, which had been started by Chinggiskhan in 1220. A luxurious palace was
built for the khan, but Ogedei preferred to live in a yurt.</p>
<p>In 1235 it seemed that the human resources of Mongolia were
insufficient to continue the policy of conquest. A project was put forward to
use Muslim troops in China, and Chinese ones in the west. Ye-lu Chu-cai managed
to counter this project, arguing that, in strange and unaccustomed
circumstances, these troops would be of little use, would involve considerable
losses and that the transfer of these troops would be too difficult. In this
case, too, Ye-lu Chu-cai defended the interests of the conquered peoples, not of
the Mongol forces.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{183} </font></b>At the conquest of China,
Ogedei promised his generals to divide the subjugated lands between them Ye-lu
Chu-cai proposed not to reward them with portions of land, which would harm the
authority of the central power, but with money, silks and valuables.</p>
<p>This set many generals and officers against him They incited
Otchigin, the khan's uncle, who denounced the minister as a foreigner who had
insidious views Ogedei learnt who led the intrigue and wanted the minister
himself to decide the fate of the slanderer Ye-lu Chu-cai disdained vengeance. A
compromise was achieved along with the Mongol rulers fiscal officials were
appointed who were categorically forbidden to take bribes from anyone at all.
The problem of taxes and the taxation system arose equally sharply. As has been
noted, Ye-lu Chu-cai had imposed a direct one per cent tax on the Mongols in
1231 In 1236 imported goods were taxed at 1/30 and wine, as a luxury, at 1/10
the sale price. Both the Uighur merchants, losing in competition with local
production, and the consumer, i.e. the Mongol military aristocracy would suffer
as a result of this.</p>
<p>But the Mongols were still more disturbed by Ye-lu Chu-cai
introducing the former system of taxation in China, from the hearth or dwelling,
while the Mongols and Muslims paid the heavier head-tax Ye-lu Chu-cai pointed
out that the population would run away, if taxes were too high, and the treasury
would suffer a loss His opinion carried the day.</p>
<p>Steadily trying to revivify Chinese culture, Ye-lu Chu-cai
founded a historical society in 1236  <a name="sik3text83"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note83">[+83]</a>
and in 1237 obtained permission to accept educated Chinese into government
service Examination colleges were established to check on their knowledge. Even
slaves could be examined, the death penalty was laid down, if their masters
stood in their way As a result, 4,030 literate persons appeared, a quarter of
whom were freed from slavery.</p>
<p>The conversion of the military monarchy into a bureaucratic
one systematically carried out by Ye-lu Chu-cai could not fail to encounter
resistance in those strata of Mongol society which were obliged to cede the
primacy they had won with their blood. But the simple-hearted and artless
Mongols could do nothing with the foreign genius who ruled them. The danger to
the minister came from another quarter.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{184} </font></b>We have seen that the system
of dues on imported goods and the restoration of Chinese production could not
suit the merchants engaged in intermediary trade and wishing to have the market
exclusively to themselves. Such were the Uighurs and the Muslims who had gone
over to the Mongol side We know the names of their leaders Kadak, entrusted with
the census of China, and Chinkai who had inherited the post of prime minister
from Ye-lu Chu-cai were Christians. The tax-farmer Abdurahman and the official
Mahmud Jalvach were Muslim renegades. These were men skilled in intrigues In
1239-40 Abdurahman had received the taxes from China on farms despite the
opinion of Ye-lu Chu-cai who had become so irritable in the course of the
argument that the khan said to him &quot;It seems you want to fight?&quot; and
added &quot;You easily feel for the people&quot;.</p>
<p>However, despite this, Ye-lu Chu-cai's position was not
weakened, since Ogedei trusted him, knowing his sincerity, honesty, intellect
and talents. The hatred of the grandees and the intrigues of the merchants
seemed powerless, but khan Ogedei died on 11 December 1241. Until the selection
of a new khan power was in the hands of Ogedei's widow, Toregena-Qatun, a Merkit
by origin.</p>
<p>It was officially announced that the khan had died of drink,
but Piano Carpini reports persistent rumours of poison, and Rashid ad-Din so
heatedly rejects this version that it involuntarily seems justified</p>
<p>In any event, on Ogedei's death Ye-lu Chu-cai's enemies&quot;
hands were freed. The Kerait Nestorian, Chinkai, replaced him in administration
and the Muslim Abdurahman as regards finance. The minister died in 1243, seeing
the collapse of the matter to which he had given his life.  <a name="sik3text84"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note84">[+84]</a></p>
<p>It would be an error to think that Toregena-Qatun's regency
was a period dominated by the war party Toregena-Qatun inherited an apparatus
sufficiently powerful to hold out for several years without turning for support
to the oppositionist social groups. This could not continue for long, but a
woman as stupid and ignorant as Toregena-Qatun did not take this into account.</p>
<p>A palace clique was in power, headed by Fatima-hanum, a
captured Persian lady, confidante of the khan's widow Intrigue and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{185}</font></b><i>
</i>wishfulness flourished. To save his life, Chinkai had
to take cover under the protection of prince Kuden, Ogedei's grandson, Mahmud
Yalvach fled by misleading the guard, and a noyan in charge of ten thousand,
Keregez, was arrested and executed on the basis of Fatima's slanders
Toregena-Qatun's rule gave rise to still more dissatisfaction than that of Ye-lu
Chu-cai.</p>
<p>The war party which in the 1230s had seemed so united was by
no means so in the 1240s. It split into two groups and the competition between
them helped Toregena-Qatun to retain power until August 1246 when Guyuk was
chosen to take the throne.</p>
<p>The Mongol army consisted of two sections unequal in numbers
Its core were veterans who had voluntarily joined Chinggiskhan and had achieved
the first victories over the Tayichi`ut, Tatars, Kerait and Naiman. At first
they had been only 13,000 men and if this number increased with additional
volunteers, it did so by very little. The basic mass of the troops consisted of
conquered nomads whom Chinggiskhan allowed to serve his throne. However, they
suffered constraints in their advancement for service only Mongols and Ongut who
had voluntarily joined Chinggiskhan were officers in charge of a thousand men In
1206 the total number of the army was 110,000, and it is clear that the veterans
were in a minority, although they held the commanding posts During Ogedei's
reign the troops were supplemented from conquered Turks, Jurchen, Tangut and
even Chinese. Clearly, the proportion of Mongols, even allowing for natural
increase, was still further reduced. Thus, it turned out that the victorious
Mongols were in a minority in the empire they had created, and the conquered and
subjugated peoples became the real force. The rulers, wishing to sit firmly on
the throne, had more and more to take account of the latter.</p>
<p>The Mongol veterans veered towards Chinggiskhan's brother,
Temuge-otchigin, who made an unsuccessful attempt to seize the throne in 1242.
This disclosed that the party of the veterans was opposed to Ogedei's line and,
thus, to his son, Guyuk. All those involved in the conspirary were executed.</p>
<p>The second party, consisting of lower rank officers of Kerait,
Naiman and Kara-Khitai origin, grouped around Tolui's widow, Sorqoqtani-Beki,
and her children Nestorianism was the ideology of this party, for in the
thirteenth century one's creed and political tendency to some extent coincided.</p>
<p>Every khan understood very well that without the sympathy and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{186} </font></b>devotion
of his troops he was nothing and, worse than that, a victim of his competitors.
And the soldiers were by no means pawns. Each of them was bound to certain
social groups and religious communes and these, in their turn, dictated their
will through the rank and file soldiers to the noyans who gave advice to the
princes. This advice was so weighty that it was impossible to ignore it. In
other words, the khan depended on the soldiers no less than the soldiers
depended on the khan, and behind both of them stood the merchants and the clergy
of various faiths, as well as the officials, shamans, tribal leaders and the
princes of subjugated lands who had survived the conquest. All of them had a
sabre at their side. This was the real force which chose a Chinggisid prince as
khan for life, but his life span was determined not by his age or health, but by
his popularity in the army and the number of those devoted to him. It is well
known that devotion can often be bought and its price varies depending on the
strain of the situation.</p>
<p>The situation of both competitors, Guyuk and Batu, was
extremely critical. Batu had only 4,000 faithful Mongol troops, clearly
insufficient to keep Eastern Europe with its six million population in obedience
by force. He could not expect help from the centre, since Guyuk was looking for
nothing but his downfall.</p>
<p>Guyuk was at the head of a force of a hundred thousand which,
for the most part, consisted of Nestorians who preferred Tolui's children to
him. Guyuk tried to achieve popularity by distributing free silk textiles among
the troops (paid for from taxes from the sedentary population). He tried to rely
on the Orthodox church and the Russian princes who had large resources of men
and money. Unfortunately for Guyuk, Grand Prince Yaroslav, who had arrived at
the khan's headquarters for negotiations, was poisoned by Toregena-Qatun on the
basis of a denunciation by one of the boyars from the prince's suite. Then
Aleksandr Nevskii and Andrei, the sons of the dead man, left Guyuk and so
actively supported Batu that he was able in 1248 to mount a campaign to the east
against the great khan. Guyuk moved to meet him, but died on the way in
unexplained circumstances.  <a name="sik3text85"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note85">[+85]</a></p>
<p>Again there was an interregnum. Guyuk's widow, Oghul-Qaimish,
a weak and ignorant woman, became regent. At the kuriltai in 1251 Batu and his
friend Mongke, Tolui's son, received <b><font COLOR="#943634">{187}
</font></b>most support The latter was chosen as great khan and
Batu was recognised as the &quot;senior member of the clan&quot; Guyuk's
adherents were executed.</p>
<p>The Russian help, thanks to which Batu had emerged from the
struggle victorious, had been dictated by deep political considerations. From
the early thirteenth century Catholic Europe had begun a crusade against the
Orthodox the Greeks and Russians. In 1204 Constantinople had been taken by the
Crusaders who founded the Latin Empire in place of Byzantium. The Letts and Ests
were subjugated and made into serfs Rus` awaited the same fate, but Aleksandr
Nevskii routed the Crusaders on the Neva in 1240 and Lake Chud in 1242 and thus
halted the first push. The war continued, however, and Aleksandr Nevskii needed
allies. Therefore, he swore brotherhood with Sartak, Batu's son, and obtained
Mongol troops to fight the Germans. The alliance was not terminated even after
Aleksandr's death. In 1269 the Germans, learning that a Mongol detachment had
appeared in Novgorod, made peace proposals &quot;for they very much feared even
the name Tatar&quot;. The Land of Rus` was saved from the invasion of the
Crusaders.  <a name="sik3text86"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note86">[+86]</a></p>
<p>The situation on the frontiers of the Mongol Empire became
more critical during the internal struggle Batu dealt with Poland, Hungary and
Bulgaria, leaving himself only Rus` and the Polovtsy steppes. However, he
granted charters and letters of authority (<i>yarlyk</i>) &quot;to the sultans
of Rum, Syria and other lands&quot;  <a name="sik3text87"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note87">[+87]</a>
in the Near East where they began to get used to the idea of the primacy of the
Golden Horde over the local military commander, Barju-noyan.</p>
<p>Batu died in 1256 and the great khan Mongke confirmed Sartak
as his heir, Sartak immediately quarrelled with his uncle Berke, declaring
&quot;You are a Muslim, but I am of the Christian faith, to see a Muslim face is
[for me] a misfortune&quot;.  <a name="sik3text88"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note88">[+88]</a>
The prince had not made a mistake a few days after his precipitate remark he was
poisoned The khan's throne passed to his son, Ulagchi, who was a minor and whose
grandmother, Boroqchin Qatun, Batu's widow, ruled on his behalf Ulagchi,
however, died as speedily as had his father, and Boroqchin, who attempted to go
to Iran in 1257, was seized and executed The Muslim Berke, who had instigated
the slaughter of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{188} </font></b>the
Nestorians in Samarkand, became khan. But he did not change the policy as
regards Aleksandr Nevskii and the Russian lands. On the contrary, when officials
of the great khan appeared in Rus` to record the population and tax them, Berke
allowed the Russian prince to organise the killing of these officials and after
this the sending of money collected in Rus`  <a name="sik3text89"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note89">[+89]</a>
to Mongolia ceased. This meant that, in fact, a break had occurred between the
Golden Horde and the centre, and the khan established in Sarai depended on his
subjects: Russians, Bulgarians and Polovtsy. Thus, there arose a symbiosis  <a name="sik3text90"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note90">[+90]</a>
of newcomers and natives, a productive coexistence which continued to the
fourteenth century. During this time Rus` managed to recover and grew stronger
because the Golden Horde acted as a barrier against the east.</p>
<p>Both problems, the western and the eastern, were solved by
Aleksandr Nevskii and were, evidently, approved by the majority of his
contemporaries which resulted in the canonisation of the prince who had found a
way out of a seemingly hopeless position.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Harsh Reality</h4>
<p>When the best troops in Europe experienced the cutting edge
of the Mongol sabres, interest in the problem of the kingdom of Prester John
rose exceedingly. It became vitally necessary to understand the nuances of
eastern policy. So, it was necessary to obtain reliable information, and then
enquiring travels to eastern countries began with aims which were often
strengthened by practical concerns. Greeks from Nicaea, Armenians from Cilicia,
Russians from Vladimir and Galich, Italian merchants from Venice and Genoa,
knights from France, England and Palestine travelled to the East, but monks
acquired the richest information: Piano Carpini sent by the Papal throne and
William of Rubruck from the court of Louis the Holy. Their reports opened the
eyes of the west Europeans to harsh reality.  <a name="sik3text91"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note91">[+91]</a></p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{189} </font></b>Piano Carpini completed his
journey in the course of two years, from 16 April 1245 to the autumn of 1247. At
first he arrived at the headquarters of Batu, but Batu did not accept the Pope's
message and sent Piano Carpini to Karakorum where he witnessed Guyuk's ascent to
the throne. After spending four months in Guyuk's headquarters, Piano Carpini
returned first to Kiev, and then to Lyon where he handed Guyuk's reply and his
own report to Pope Innocent IV.</p>
<p>Rubruck encountered quite another period After leaving
Constantinople for the Crimea in May 1253, he first arrived at Sartak's
headquarters, then at Batu's horde and, finally, at Karakorum where Mongke-qan
was ruling. He saw and described much more than Piano Carpini, despite the fact
that he returned to Europe in 1254. The conclusions of both travellers coincided
the Mongols were not Christians, only memories remained of the Kingdom of
Prester John, and the Nestorians were no friends and brothers for Catholic
Europe, but heretics and enemies. The last conclusion determined the conduct of
the papal throne as regards the eastern Christians for the whole subsequent
period.</p>
<p>The material brought back by these and some other travellers
is so extensive and has been so abundantly commented on by scholars of different
countries and times that we shall limit ourselves to brief extracts directly
related to our subject.</p>
<p>Piano Carpini mentions Prester John once, in a retrospective
sketch of Chinggiskhan's campaigns At first he lists the wars which actually
took place in history, then battles with amazons, dog-men and subterranean
people, the episode of a battle between the Mongols and the Indian troops of a
king &quot;whom the people of that land [India] called Prester John&quot;  <a name="sik3text92"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note92">[+92]</a>
is located between history and fable and should, undoubtedly, be included with
the latter. On the other hand, he writes absolutely specifically about the trend
of Guyuk's policy as aggressive and pointed against Catholic Europe, warning his
compatriots of the threatening danger.</p>
<p>Guyuk's death and the reversal in policy made by Batu saved
Europe because the Nestorians who came to power urged Mongke into war with the
Muslims. Thus, Rubruck encountered a less guarded reception and collected more
information With him Prester John is interpreted as a recently dead king of the
Naiman,  <a name="sik3text93"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note93">[+93]</a> <b><font COLOR="#943634">{190}
</font></b>i.e. Rubruck's reconstruction coincides with that
expounded in this book. Legends interest him much less than reality, and he has
a lot to say about the Nestorians. According to his description, the Nestorians
are people little skilled in the finer points of theology,  <a name="sik3text94"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note94">[+94]</a>
usurers, drunkards and are polygamous; they do not fast on Fridays and care more
for their families than for disseminating the faith.</p>
<p>It did not escape Rubruck's notice that the majority of
Mongke-qan's princesses and courtiers openly professed Nestorianism, but the
khans themselves did not declare their views. Evidently, adherence to Mongol
religion was obligatory in order to rule Mongols. Those who were known as
Christians, such as, for example, Sartak  <a name="sik3text95"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note95">[+95]</a>
and Arik-Boke, did not acknowledge this officially. Therefore, the
Nestorians&quot; influence was restricted and their situation insecure. They
were hostile to Orthodoxy, but they wished to achieve mutual understanding with
the Catholics and admitted them to communion without demanding a repudiation of
their faith. We shall see below what this led to.</p>
<p>Ethnography, i.e. popular customs which were taken to be
religious prohibitions, hindered the fusion of the Orthodox and the Nestorians,
quite apart from causes rooted in dogma and history. For example, the Russians,
Greeks, Osetians and Georgians counted it a sin to drink kumis. If they were
obliged to drink it, the clergy reconciled the sinners to the Church as if they
had forsaken the Christian faith.  <a name="sik3text96"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note96">[+96]</a>
It goes without saying that nomads could not live without kumis, and such
revulsion appalled them.</p>
<p>Two stimuli always play a part in human conduct, both social
and personal: the search for advantage; and sincerity, which we must understand
as a system of historically determined views, of particular psychological
reactions, nuances in relation to the external world and the features of their
self-development specific to a particular ethnic culture.</p>
<p>Ideal concepts always smash themselves against the reality of
everyday life. So it was in this case. Differences in dogma between Catholic,
Orthodox and Nestorian were insignificant and it was not these which hindered
mutual understanding between Latins, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{191}
</font></b>Greeks and Mongols. After all, in Eastern Asia in 1142
the Nestorians had been reconciled with the monophysites, the Jacobites,
although their dogma and teleological positions were at the extremes on the
scale of religious differences. It can be said that religious consciousness is
an element in historical reality, but it does not exhaust it. The steppe nomads,
becoming Christians, remained barbarians in the eyes of the Greeks, and savages
in the eyes of the Latins and, though not heathen, they were heretics; in both
cases they were strangers. For contact to arise decades of living together,
interpenetration, being comrades in arms, and a community of interests were
needed. All this could not occur at the first encounter, the more so since both
sides were more concerned about politics. Therefore, Rubruck was right when he
ended his work with the advice: &quot;It seems to me useless for any brother
henceforth to go to the Tatars as I have done or as the preaching brethren go,
but if the Pope ... wished to send a bishop ... he could say all that he wants
to them and even make them sign it.&quot;  <a name="sik3text97"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note97">[+97]</a>
Rubruck's recommendations were accepted and the consequences were truly
enormous.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>When the Tale Became a True Story</h4>
<p>The legend of the arrival of eastern Christians striving to
help the Crusaders liberate the Holy Sepulchre began to come to life with a
delay of a hundred years in all. After defeating the Khwarizm troops of Jalal-ad-Din,
in 1231, the Mongols arrived at the edge of the upper Tigris and occupied the
very position where the Europeans a hundred years earlier had imagined the
troops of the mythical pontiff John to be. The head of the Mongol forces,
Chormagan, had two relatives-in-law who were Nestorians and was himself inclined
lo this faith.  <a name="sik3text98"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note98">[+98]</a> Simeon,
the plenipotentiary for religious affairs, often called Rabban-ata, was a
fervent Christian and built churches in Tabriz where formerly it had been
forbidden to utter the name of Christ. Finally, the head of the civil
administration, the Uighur Korkuz (George), was, it seems, a god-seeker. Judging
by his name, lie came from a Christian family, but he arrived in Khurasan as a
Buddhist, afterwards went over to Islam, but did not cease to be a <b><font COLOR="#943634">{192</font>}
</b>fanatic and helped in every way to alleviate the
burdens of the subjugated population.  <a name="sik3text99"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note99">[+99]</a></p>
<p>It might seem that the Crusaders' dream had been realised:
they had obtained a powerful ally for the struggle against the Muslims. But in
the Kingdom of Jerusalem not the slightest interest was shown in the Mongols. In
Acre in 1241 the Templars slaughtered members of the Order of St John and of the
Teutonic Order; on Cyprus the adherents of the house of Ibelin threw out by
military force the German barons who had been left there by Frederick II to
strengthen the Christian forces in the East; at sea the Venetians attacked the
Genoese.  <a name="sik3text100"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note100">[+100]</a> In
short, the war of the Guelphs and Ghibellines rent Palestine as much as it did
Italy.</p>
<p>The Crusaders, occupied in settling their domestic accounts,
lost the chance to establish relations with the Mongols. In 1242 the sick
Chormagan was replaced by Baiju-noyan, an ardent Mongol old hand without any
ideological sympathies. He set about establishing order on the frontiers and
drove the last detachments of unconquered Khwarizmians from Mesopotamia in 1244.
They went to seek refuge in Egypt and, on the way, took Jerusalem which had
recently been freed by Frederick II and returned to the Jerusalem crown (1229).
The Crusaders united with the Syrian Ayyubids for war against Egypt, but on 18
October 1244 the Khwarizmians and Egyptians completely routed the Crusaders at
Gaza and then took Damascus. The Khwarizmians, converted into mercenaries by the
Egyptians, attempted to rebel, but were pacified in 1245 and almost completely
exterminated, after which the Egyptians took Ascalon from the Crusaders.
Simultaneously, the Turkmen from Iconium fell on the principality of Antioch and
severely mauled Boemund's knights.</p>
<p>Against the background of these gloomy events the Dominican
monks Ascelin and Guichard of Cremona arrived at Baiju's headquarters on 24 May
1247 and without any diplomatic art proposed he should submit to the Pope. He
almost executed them!  <a name="sik3text101"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note101">[+101]</a>
But after a month and a half the situation changed. In place of Baiju a friend
of Guyuk was appointed, Elchidei-noyan, who let Ascelin go (25 July 1247) and a
year later sent an embassy to Innocent IV in <b><font COLOR="#943634">{193}
</font></b>Rome and Louis IX on Cyprus. The latter sent Andrew of
Longjumeau, a Dominican, for negotiations; he reached Karakorum after the khan
had died. The regent, Oghul-Qaimish, not understanding the significance of the
embassy, demanded tribute, threatening the French people with extinction.  <a name="sik3text102"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note102">[+102]</a>
Surely it could have been foreseen what stupidities a foolish woman would utter?
 <a name="sik3text103"></a><a href="sik3b.htm#sik3note103">[+103]</a></p>
<p>The disheartened emissaries returned to Caesarea on 6 April
1251 and found their king broken by failure and captivity. The attempt at
contact had ended lamentably and even the hope of it was lost in the autumn of
that year when Elchidei-noyan was executed as a friend of Guyuk. Louis regretted
sending a mission to Karakorum and, therefore, it seems, his second emissary,
Rubruck, conducted himself there extremely carefully and limited himself to
collecting information, abstaining from diplomatic negotiations with Mongke-qan.</p>
<p>Greek diplomats displayed great flexibility. They succeeded
in establishing a friendly understanding with the Mongols and an agreement
against the Seljuks thanks to which the Empire of Nicea freed its hands for a
Balkan war which ended with the liberation of Constantinople from the Latins on
25 July 1261.</p>
<p>Thus, the completion of the tale seemed to the Europeans flat
and uninteresting. The Mongol nestorians had to count only on themselves and
their co-religionists, a small number of whom languished under the heavy heel of
the Muslim sultans in Syria and Asia Minor. The Mongols, though, carefully
studied the situation and considered a campaign in Palestine. The campaign
should and would have succeeded, had forces whose appearance no one could have
foreseen not entered the game.</p>
