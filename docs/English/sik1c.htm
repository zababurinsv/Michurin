<h4>On the Line of the Chinese Wall</h4>
<p>Although China came into contact with nomad peoples living
north of the Huang He in ancient times, we can only discern the nature of these
relations from the third century B.C. This was the time when China was united by
the Qin Emperor Shi Huang-di (221 B.C.). At the same time the Chinese Wall was
built, separating China and the Great Steppe. The Wall was carried both along
China's geographic, and also its ethnographic frontier; the Chinese considered
the population north of the Wall &quot;barbarians&quot;, different both in
origin and in form of life, and politically hostile, for which they had
exceedingly good cause. That was where the power of the Hun was formed.</p>
<p>The territory occupied by the Hun, present day Inner and
Outer Mongolia, Dzungaria and Southern Siberia, was exceedingly convenient for
nomadic herding, since, at the technical level of the day, it could not be used
for cultivation. Therefore, the Hun economy was specialised: they had an
abundance of meat, hides and pelts, but, like all nomads, required grain and
textiles. It was easiest to obtain these items from China by barter, in which
the Chinese population very willingly took part; but the imperial government and
its advisers stood between the peoples. The Qin and Han emperors required the
means to maintain their armies of soldiers and officials and took the trade with
the Hun into their own hands; the consequence was that the Hun began to receive
considerably less textiles and grain than they needed. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text18"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note18">[+18]</a></font>
The Hun answer was war and by 152 B.C. they had achieved the opening of the
barter-trade market. In 133 the Chinese renewed hostilities and, using their
numerical advantage, pushed the Hun north of the Gobi desert. However, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{28}
</font></b>attempts to conquer the Hun ended in the complete
defeat of a Chinese expeditionary force in 90 B.C.  <a name="sik1text19"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note19">[+19]</a></p>
<p>A fresh advance by the Chinese on the Hun, beginning in 72
B.C., was effected by diplomacy: the Chinese were able to sow dissension among
the nomad tribes and to raise their neighbours against the Hun: the Dzungarian
Usuni, the Sayan Dinlin and the Xing'an Wuhuan. Inter-clan warfare which flared
up among the Hun themselves in 58 B.C. made Chinese victory easy. One of the
claimants to the throne allied himself with China, others perished. In 52 B.C.
the Hun recognised the authority of China.</p>
<p>Peace was preserved as long as Chinese authority in the
steppe remained nominal, but as soon as the usurper Wang Mang attempted in A.D.
9 to intervene in the internal affairs of the Hun they rose and, tying down the
government forces on the frontier, they supported a rising by the &quot;Red
Eyebrows&quot;, the Chinese peasants heavily oppressed by Wang Mang. The Later
Han dynasty, which came to power in A.D. 25, again had to face the &quot;Hun
problem&quot;. Only the split of the Hun power into the Southern and Northern
branches, as well as a union with the Xianbi (Ancient Mongol) tribes occupying
Manchuria and the Eastern Trans-Baikal area before the third century, allowed
the Chinese to form a coalition which routed the Northern Hun in 93. But all the
same the Chinese failed to gain the steppe. Tanshikhai, the leader of the Xianbi,
gained a series of victories over the Chinese troops and even transferred
military activities to the south of the Chinese Wall. By 177 all the Chinese
conquests had been lost.</p>
<p>Naturally, in the time that had passed, Chinese political
thought had been fixed on the &quot;Hun problem&quot;. Two solutions had been
proposed. The historians Sima qian and Ban Gu were opposed to further aggression
towards the north. Sima qian considered that the conquest of a country with a
completely different climate and features from that in which Chinese were
accustomed to live was unrealisable; Ban Gu found the inclusion into the empire
of a people different in culture harmful, and the assimilation of the nomads
unnecessary to both sides.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text20"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note20">[+20]</a></font>
But the imperial government did not accept the scholars&quot; opinion and they
were arrested. Sima qian was mutilated and freed, but Ban Gu died in prison.</p>
<p>The second concept dominated and was consistently followed by <b><font COLOR="#943634">{29} </font></b>the Han
emperors, beginning with Wu-di (140-87 B.C.). This aspired to create a world
empire by conquering neighbouring peoples and planting amongst them the
Confucian variant of Chinese culture. In pursuit of this programme, Chaoxian (northern
Korea), Yue - north and south (in Guangdong and Indochina) - and the nomadic
Tibetan tribes about Lake Koko Nor were conquered. War in the north, however,
not only turned out to be unsuccessful, but also involved China's complete
economic exhaustion. Wonderfully equipped armies at full strength with selected
soldiers and often led by very gifted commanders either suffered defeat, or were
unable to consolidate the successes they had achieved with difficulty. In the
second century A.D. Han China entered a very severe social, economic and
political crisis and was unable to fight the nomads successfully.</p>
<p>Military expenditures increased the tax burden on the
peasants who finally responded with the rising of the &quot;Yellow Turbans&quot;
which broke the power of the Han dynasty (184). The demoralised Han troops were
unable to cope with the rising. The aristocrats, members of powerful houses,
took the initiative. They conquered the peasants, but then fell out and, at the
head of individual armies, set upon one another and for the most part perished
in internecine strife. Three who survived founded three kingdoms in the north,
south-east and west after tearing China to pieces for half a century (220-80).</p>
<p>Thus the Han Empire fell, one of four world empires (along
with the Roman, Parthian and Kushan empires) of antiquity.</p>
<p>This was a real catastrophe for China. Suffice it to say that
from 221 to 280 the population declined from 50 million taxpayers to 7.5 million.
<font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text21"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note21">[+21]</a></font> The towns lay in
ruins. With the <i>coup d'etat </i>of Sima Yan, the landowners and Confucian
scholars were replaced by demoralised soldiers who understood the tasks facing
their country even less. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text22"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note22">[+22]</a></font>
The lands beyond the Wall again passed into the hands of the nomads, and bloody
feuds between cliques at court placed China on the verge of a new catastrophe.</p>
<p>But perhaps it was not China, but the Hun who were the cause
of the bitter war which contributed to the fall of the Han Empire?</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{30} </font></b>There is a very widespread
prejudiced opinion that the Hun were wild brigands who offended their quiet,
industrious neighbours. This conception rests on the fact that in Europe the Hun
were at the head of the numerous tribes of Ugrians, Alans, Antes and Germans and
started the Great Migration of Peoples during which the Western Roman Empire
fell. Incidentally, here too the Romans were by no means harmless little lambs
suffering at the evil hands of the Hun and other barbarians. The barbarians had
something for which to avenge themselves on Rome.</p>
<p>The situation in Asia was somewhat different. First of all we
note that the Hun strove not for territorial acquisitions, but for the
organisation of barter trade on an equal footing. In 200 B.C. at the hamlet of
Baideng (in Shanxi) they had surrounded a detachment accompanying the Emperor;
they released him after concluding a treaty of &quot;peace and kinship&quot;
without any territorial concessions. The Hun based themselves on the view that
if they seized Chinese lands, they would not be able to live on them. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text23"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note23">[+23]</a></font>
They equally calmly accepted the secession of the Usuni who migrated into the
Seven Streams area and the Western Tianshan.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text24"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note24">[+24]</a></font> But they desperately defended their own lands and when
they lost Yinshan &quot;they wept when they passed it&quot;.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text25"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note25">[+25]</a> </font>Their wars with China were not aggressive, but
defensive.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the Hun were able to create conditions of
life in the steppe a good deal easier than those in ancient China. A report of
the official Hou Ying (1st century B.C.) shows that the inhabitants along the
frontier oppressed by Chinese officials, the unfree, the criminals and the
families of political emigrants dreamed only of going into the steppes, saying
that &quot;it is enjoyable to live among the Hun&quot; .<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text26"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note26">[+26]</a></font> The Hun power had so great a population from various
tribes that they formed an independent ethnic unit which the Chinese historians
called the &quot;Zilu&quot; tribe.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text27"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note27">[+27]</a> </font>Assimilation
with the original Hun population could not take place since the new arrivals did
not enter the Hun clan and tribal system, yet they lived in peace and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{31}
</font></b>friendship, helping one another in economic activities
and in defence of their country.</p>
<p>It is wrong to think that technical progress is impossible in
nomad society. Nomads in general, and the Hun and Turks in particular, invented
objects which have now entered into the daily life of the whole of mankind as
something indispensable to man. Such a form of clothing as trousers, without
which the present-day European cannot imagine the male, were invented by nomads
in deep antiquity. The stirrup appeared in Central Asia between 200 and 400.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text28"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note28">[+28]</a> </font>The original nomad drag on wooden stumps was first
replaced by the cart with high wheels,<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text29"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note29">[+29]</a></font>
and then by the pack saddle which allowed the nomads to force mountain ranges
overgrown with forest.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text30"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note30">[+30]</a></font>
Nomads invented the curved sabre which supplanted the heavy straight sword and
the improved compound bow which could shoot arrows to a distance of 700 m.
Finally, the round yurt was then considered the most perfect type of dwelling.</p>
<p>As regards not only material culture, but mental culture as
well, the nomads did not lag behind their sedentary neighbours, though their
literature was an oral one. Obviously, it would be absurd to search for Hun
scientific theories: even the Greeks borrowed them from the ancient Egyptians
and Babylonians. The nomads created two genres of tales: the heroic tale and the
demonological novella. Both of these were closer to mythology than to literature
in our sense of the word, but this was how they perceived reality and expressed
their feelings. In other words, for them mythology bore the same functions as
literature does for us.</p>
<p>The nomads also perceived history in similar fashion, i.e.
unlike we do. It seemed to them a developed clan genealogy; it was not an event
or an institution, but a dead ancestor that was the standard. Such an account of
generations seems without sense to Europeans, but it too reflects the flow of
time, like any system of counting accepted by scholarship. It is simply adapted
to other aims and needs which it meets fully. Moreover, we have to remember that
we <b><font COLOR="#943634">{32} </font></b>have
derived data on the folklore and history of the ancient nomads from ethnographic
analogies, fragmentary information and so on, so it is very approximate. On the
other hand, their works of art have come down to us as originals and afford us
an incomparably fuller impression of what in fact existed in the ancient steppes.
Splendid art objects have been uncovered by the excavations of P.K. Kozlov, G.V.
Kiselev and S.I. Rudenko; this is the &quot;animal style&quot; which enables us
to assert the cultural proximity of the Hun to the peoples of Siberia and
Central Asia.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text31"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note31">[+31]</a></font>
Chinese objects are also often encountered in the barrow burials: silk textiles,
bronze objects and lacquer cups. These were everyday articles acquired by the
Hun as plunder or tribute, and also produced by the Chinese who had fled to the
Hun (the Zilu). But such things by no means define the direction of the
culture's development.  <a name="sik1text32"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note32">[+32]</a></p>
<p>We have dealt with this in such detail so as to reject the
philistine opinion of the notorious lack of value of the Central Asian nomadic
peoples, allegedly a mere Chinese periphery. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text33"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note33">[+33]</a></font>
In fact, these peoples developed independently and intensively; only the Chinese
aggression of the first century broke off their existence which was, as we have
seen, equally tragic for the Hun and for China. But historical retribution was
not obliged to wait.</p>
<p>In A.D. 304 the elders of the southern Hun, who had become
subject to the Chinese, decided to regain their lost rights by force of arms.
Taking advantage of the chaotic administration of the Jin dynasty, they quickly
took both Chinese capitals - Loyang and Chang'an - and the whole of Northern
China. Following the Hun, Tibetans penetrated into China, the Xianbi-Muyun and
Tabghach (Toba).<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text34"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note34">[+34]</a> </font>After
bloody struggles among themselves and with the Chinese, who had been driven into
the Yangzi basin, the Toba came out on top and founded a mighty empire which
officially took a Chinese name - Wei. This state was Chinese in the eyes of the
steppe nomads, but barbarian to the Chinese. In essence, though, it <b><font COLOR="#943634">{33}
</font></b>started a particular series of frontier formations not
to be related to any one culture, though they all consisted of a combination of
Chinese and nomadic elements.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text35"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note35">[+35]</a></font>
This, however, was no longer a clan or tribal power, but a feudal empire with
conditional landholding, enserfment of the free population and the distribution
of districts in return for service.</p>
<p>In the Wei state, Chinese replaced Toba as the language of
administration from 495, and the Xianbi dress and hair style were officially
forbidden. Yet all these measures failed to reconcile the Chinese population,
conquered by force of arms, with the foreign power. Too weak to organise a
rising, the Chinese penetrated into the administration and military. Gradually
actual authority was concentrated in the hands of commanders of Chinese origin;
in 550 they disposed of the Wei dynasty whose members, including babies at the
breast, were hacked into small pieces and thrown into the Yellow River. China
again became Chinese, but the descendants of the Tabghach, who had forgotten
their native language, continued to live along the Great Wall on the steppe
frontier.</p>
<p>A new power arose in the steppe at this time, one
considerably more powerful than the Hun. The Great Turkic Kaganate, for the
brief period from 550 to 569, united the steppes from the Yellow to the Black
Sea and added Central Asia to it, and did this with the agreement of the Sogdian
inhabitants. The latter became rich from the caravan trade in silk which they
forwarded from China to Europe. As soon as the Turkic khans ceased their
internal wars and plunder in the steppe, the Sogdians became their true friends
and helpers.</p>
<p>The formation of the Turkic Kaganate, however, was regarded
quite differently in China where, in 581, power fell to a clique of landholding
Shaanxi magnates led by Yang Jian, founder of the Sui dynasty. The restoration
of the former might of the Han empire, and consequently war with the Turks,
became the programme of this dynasty. In a word, the collision of the first
century was repeated, the only difference being that, instead of inter-tribal
quarrels, the Chinese spies (Zhaiang-sun Sheng, Fei Gui) incited feuds between
the independent princes of the Turkic ruling clan.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{34} </font></b>The next three centuries were
filled with events mainly concerned with the struggle of the freedom-loving
nomads against Chinese aggression. The Turks had dealings with many peoples, but
neither Byzantium, nor Iran, still less the Siberian Ugrians, attempted to
subordinate them, but limited themselves to establishing diplomatic links and
preserving their own frontiers. The Turks, in their turn, when engaged in armed
clashes with Persians or Greeks, pursued economic and political aims connected
with the caravan trade. These clashes were historically inevitable since the
Turks, uniting the Great Steppe, took on themselves the problems of the peoples
included in the Great Kaganate.  <a name="sik1text36"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note36">[+36]</a></p>
<p>Relations between Turks and Chinese took quite a different
turn; in China an anti-Turk attitude became the dominant tendency in foreign
policy from the sixth century. The establishment of power over Asia, once the
aim of the Han dynasty, became the basic task of the Chinese feudal lords and
officials. They did not seek, or even wish for, compromise solutions. Even the
fall of the Sui dynasty and the troubles borne by their country and people<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text37"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note37">[+37]</a></font> failed to make the Chinese lords abandon these
senseless pretensions. Defeated in a civil war by their own frontier forces, the
descendants of the Tabghach, who had established the Tang dynasty with a regime
that at first was acceptable to both the Turkic and Chinese people, they
diverted policy into its usual channel by intrigues and conspiracies, thus
evoking the risings of Kutlug El'teres khan<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text38"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note38">[+38]</a></font> and An Lushan<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text39"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note39">[+39]</a> </font>which again spilt Chinese blood. In the following
century (764-861) the Chinese in vain tried to retain their key positions in the
Great <b><font COLOR="#943634">{35} </font></b>Steppe
and again achieve dominance. The Uigurs defended the independence of their
homeland and the Tibetans took the Chinese forts in Shaanxi (Shenhsi) and
prevented even the possibility of revenge. Although neither the Uigur khanate,
nor the Tibetan monarchy outlived the Tang dynasty, Chinese aggression had been
halted.</p>
<p>The explanation for the alleged stagnation of the Middle
Asian peoples lies in this fierce struggle. These peoples were not inferior to
Europeans in talent, bravery or intellect, but the Turks and Uigurs spent those
forces which others used to develop their culture on the defence of their
independence against a numerous, cunning and fierce enemy. For 300 years they
had not a moment's peace, but they came out of the war as victors and had
defended their native land for their descendants.</p>
<p>No less noteworthy is the non-acceptance of Chinese culture
by all the peoples of east Central Asia. The Turks had their own system of ideas
which they clearly counterposed to the Chinese one. A period of change of faith
in Asia ensued after the fall of the Second Kaganate. The Uigurs then accepted
Manichaeism, the Karluk Islam, the Basmil and Ongut Nestorianism, the Tibetans
Buddhism in its Indian form, but Chinese ideology did not pass beyond the Great
Wall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Steppe Byzantinism</h4>
<p>When we pronounce the word &quot;Byzantium&quot; entirely
without explanation or addition, the content of the concept varies. It may be
that Byzantium is the Eastern Roman Empire, a relict of one time greatness, in
decline over a thousand years. That was how both Gibbon and Le Beau, who called
this state <i>Le Bas-Empire, </i>understood &quot;Byzantium&quot;, as also did
Vladimir Solov`ev. The term may be understood as the Greek kingdom which arose
as an antithesis to degenerate antiquity and had its own rhythm of development,
its light and shade. That was how Uspenskii, Kulakovskii and Diehl saw it.</p>
<p>Perhaps, though, Byzantium is simply a huge town, a focus of
trade and cultivated life which arose on the shores of a blue sea, surrounded by
burnt hills where for centuries a semi-wild population pastured goats and
gathered olives and grapes. This, too, is a legitimate understanding of the term,
but in this work -we want to use a fourth meaning: Byzantium is a culture,
unique aid varied, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{36} </font></b>scattered
far beyond the state frontiers of the Constantinople empire. Flashes of its
golden rays settled on the green valleys of Ireland (Johannes Scotus Erigena),
in the dense forests of the Trans-Volga (Nil Sorskii and the non-possessors), in
the tropical table-land around Lake Tsan (Aksum) and in the Great Eurasian
Steppe, as we shall explain.</p>
<p>In this conception, the term &quot;Byzantium&quot; is not
only Constantinople and the country subordinate to it, not only even the
Chalcedon creed, but the unity including Orthodox and heretics alike:
monophysites and Nestorians, Christians and gnostics (Markionites and
Manichaeans, of whom we shall also speak). That these currents of thought
contended with one another does not contradict the proposed meaning of the term,
for the struggle of ideas and of politics is also a form of link, a kind of
development.</p>
<p>From the moment of its origin Christian religious thought
diverged into numerous streams of which the majority dried up; but some became
mighty rivers. A small group of Judean Christians, i.e. Jews who recognised the
arrival of the Messiah, disappeared without trace. On the other hand, Paul's
mission, addressed to educated heathens, found many converts. The Hellenes were
particularly startled by the idea, then strange to them, of the existence of
evil, and they began to interpret it in various ways: those most educated and
able to think logically put the responsibility for all the world's injustice and
unhappiness on him who had created it and in irritation called him the &quot;demiurge&quot;,
i.e. the handicraftsman. They considered the demiurge a not very important demon
who had created the world and man (Adam) so that Adam might live in ignorance
and be the demiurge's plaything. But the wise serpent enlightened Adam and
helped him to gain his freedom; for that the demiurge torments the descendants
of Adam and Eve.</p>
<p>This school of thought gave rise to gnosticism, a religious
and philosophical conception for wise and educated people (from <i>gnosis, </i>knowledge).
We need not describe the three main trends of gnosticism: Egyptian, Syrian and
Markionite (from the name of the Christian gnostic, Markion), but deal only with
the splendid conception of the Persian thinker, Mani (third century), who united
Christian, Zoroastrian and even Indian ideas. Mani taught that there exists a
&quot;raging darkness&quot;, a space of eternal gloom, with clots still darker
than its own medium. These accumulations of darkness move randomly, like
molecules in Brownian motion; but once, by <b><font COLOR="#943634">{37}
</font></b>chance, they approached the limits of their space, the
frontier of the &quot;Eternal Light&quot; and attempted to enter it in order to
darken the &quot;Kingdom of Light&quot;. The bearer of the principle of light,
whom Mani calls the &quot;Primal Man&quot; and to whom he ascribes the qualities
of Ormuzd, came forth to fight them. The forces of darkness were victorious,
tore the &quot;Primal Man&quot; to pieces and shrouded the particles of light,
which now languish in captivity, in darkness. Christ came to help these
particles, i.e. souls, and after him Mani, the embodiment of the Holy Ghost, the
Paraclete Comforter. They have come to free souls from matter, crystallized
darkness; so it follows that all that is material, all that binds man to the
world and to life is sinful.</p>
<p>The Christians struggled against this conception, asserting
that the creator of the world is good and that the world he created is beautiful.
Monistic systems arose to counterbalance gnosticism: neoplatonism, asserting
that matter is nothing <i>(meon) </i>and the world is an outflow from God's ribs,
the plenitude of all that is; and Christian monism in the teaching of Origen who
taught that after the end of the world and the Day of Judgement the devil, by
God's mercy, will be forgiven.</p>
<p>By the fourth century Orthodox thought had acquired
individual elements of all these conceptions and had crystallised into a
particular philosophical system. But then new difficulties began to be
encountered, purely theological, not philosophical ones, which were reflected in
fierce struggles at the ecumenical councils.</p>
<p>Four trends appeared in Christian thought: the Arian which
was widespread among the German tribes; the Nestorian which was most important
for our subject; the monophysite which arose as the antithesis of Nestorianism;
and the Chalcedon (from the place where the Fourth Council took place) which
became the dominant confession of the Byzantine Empire.</p>
<p>Hither Asia was the volcano of freethought in the first
centuries A.D. Early in the fourth century, the Alexandrian presbyter Arius
preached that Christos-Logos was less than his father, for he was the son and,
so, born. The Archbishop Alexander and his deacon, Athanasius, rebutted Arius,
pointing out that the word made flesh is inapplicable to a divine being, and
accused him of the heresy of Paul of Samosata who taught that Christ was a man
endowed with heavenly wisdom. The dispute rapidly turned into a civil war, and
some emperors supported Arius, others the Orthodox. At the same <b><font COLOR="#943634">{38}
</font></b>time, the gnostics, neoplatonists and Mithraists
preached their teachings and each struggled against all the others.</p>
<p>We should not think that the representatives of these
teachings were insincere in the adherence to the creeds of their faith. In those
days, the demand for a logical view of the world was very acute.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text40"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note40">[+40]</a></font> Of course, it was not chance that the most rational
and literal interpretations of religious dogma were linked with the Antioch
school, philosophical ones with the Alexandrian, and emotional and aesthetic
ones with the Constantinople where the Hellenic element predominated among the
population. But we have no need to deal further with the upheavals of religious
struggles in the Roman Empire and can focus our attention on the penetration of
the Far East and the limitless expanse of the Great Steppe by this seething,
burning thought.  <a name="sik1text41"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note41">[+41]</a></p>
<p>After the thinker and writer, Mani, declaring himself the
heir of Christ and Paracletus, tormented by the Mobeds, the Zoroastrian clergy,
had accepted a martyr's crown in 277 at Gundishapur, the residence of the
Persian shah, his followers were obliged to flee from Persia; but in the West
Manichaeism was subject to constant persecution and went underground.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text42"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note42">[+42]</a></font> In the East the Manichaes found refuge in Trans-Oxania
and in the oases along the great caravan route.
 <a name="sik1text43"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note43">[+43]</a></p>
<p>The Patriarch of Constantinople, Nestorius, imprudently
declaring that &quot;God has no mother&quot;, was anathematised at the
Ecumenical Council of Ephesus in 431. Those who had vanquished him immediately
fell out among themselves, but both monophysites and Orthodox Chalcedonites were
unanimously impatient of Nestorian-ism. Enmity intensified particularly after
434 when, at a council in Bit-Zapat, Nestorianism was recognised as the dominant
creed of the Persian Christians, including the members of the Merv
metropolitanate. The Persian shah's support for the Byzantine Nestorians was
fateful. In 489 the Emperor Zeno confirmed the condemnation of the Nestorians
and closed the Edessa school <b><font COLOR="#943634">{39} </font></b>where
the Nestorians taught their faith. The school transferred to Persia, to Nizib,
and a Nestorian patriarchate arose in Ctesiphon in 499 and flourished in the
sixth century.  <a name="sik1text44"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note44">[+44]</a></p>
<p>From Persia the Nestorians spread widely throughout Eastern
Asia. In the sixth century the Christians preached their faith with some success
among the nomad Turks. Turks captured by the Byzantines at the battle of
Balyarat in 591 had a tattooed cross on their lips and explained that this had
been done on the advice of Christians living among them as a means of avoiding
plague.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text45"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note45">[+45]</a></font> This
fact does not tell us anything about the spread of Christianity among
sixth-century nomad Turks, but it does allow us to assert the presence of
Christians in the steppe.</p>
<p>In 636 Nestorianism penetrated into China and was greeted
benevolently by the government.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text46"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note46">[+46]</a></font>
The first Tang emperors, Tai-zong and Gao-zong, protected the Christians and
allowed them to build churches. During the usurpation of the throne by the
empress Wu Ze-tian who had links with the Buddhists, persecution of the
Christians started, but the usurper was rapidly deprived of power by the
adherents of the Tang dynasty. In 714 the emperor Xuan-zong decreed the
prohibition of Buddhism in the empire, and in 745 allowed the preaching of
Christianity.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text47"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note47">[+47]</a></font>
From this time Nestorianism began to spread in Dzungaria, which was under the
control of the Tang empire, and to make converts among the nomads, mainly the
Basmil, but for quite a long time its success was small.</p>
<p>The spread of Nestorianism encountered opposition not from
local religions, which had entered a decline after the fall of the Turkic
Kaganate, but from proselytizing religions like itself: Buddhism, Islam,
Manichaeism and Bon. For a long time the first two religions had no followers in
the steppe. Ton'yukuk hindered Buddhist propaganda on the grounds that &quot;the
Buddha's teaching makes people weak and makes them love their fellow men&quot;.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text48"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note48">[+48]</a></font> The Turgish khan Aulu replied to the emissary of the
caliph Hisham <b><font COLOR="#943634">{40} </font></b>(723-43):
&quot;there are no barbers, smiths or tailors among my warriors; if they become
Muslim and follow the rules of Islam, where will they gain their
livelihood?&quot; <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text49"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note49">[+49]</a></font>
Islam seemed to the nomads an exclusively urban religion, and they reacted to it
in the same way as the Arabian Bedouin did a century ago. But the Manichaes,
driven from Chinese possessions by the emperor Xuan-zong m 732,<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text50"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note50">[+50]</a></font> found adherents among the Uighurs and supported khan
Moyuncur in a burdensome internal war.  <a name="sik1text51"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note51">[+51]</a></p>
<p>In so far as the Christians were opponents of the Uighur
khan, after his victory he inclined to the side of the Manichaes who had
supported him. Soon the Uighurs became a theocratic power where the Manichaen
community ruled.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text52"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note52">[+52]</a></font>
Only military affairs were left to the khan.</p>
<p>The Manichaes, once in power, displayed such religious
intolerance<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text53"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note53">[+53]</a></font> that
they quarreled with all their neighbours: Tibetan Buddhists and followers of
Bon, Siberian shamanists, Muslim, Chinese and, of course, Nestorians. We shall
not here follow the political history of Uighuria, but only note that when this
land was crippled by the Kirghiz in 840-7, the Manichae community perished with
it.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text54"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note54">[+54]</a></font> Deserted
after the Uighurs had left for the south, the steppes were gradually settled by
Mongol-speaking tribes. The cultural tradition was for a time broken, but as
soon as some sort of order had been established Nestorianism simply flooded
Central Asia.</p>
<p>But in China, where Nestorianism had been tolerated from 635,<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text55"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note55">[+55]</a></font> the Tang government issued a special decree in 845
declaring it <b><font COLOR="#943634">{41} </font></b>illegal,
along with Buddhism and Manichaeism. This event coincided with the destruction
of Uighuria whom China had hitherto needed as an ally and who had protected the
interests and life of the nomads living within the confines of the Middle
Empire.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text56"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note56">[+56]</a></font> The
Christians resisted the persecutions which followed the decree much more than
did the Buddhists and Manichaes. But the position of Christianity in China was
greatly undermined. In 987 a Christian monk who had returned to Constantinople
from the Far East said that &quot;the Christians in China have disappeared and
been destroyed for various reasons and that he alone had escaped&quot;.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik1text57"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note57">[+57]</a></font> We may be sure that there is exaggeration here and
that fragments of Nestorianism remained on the northern frontier of China until
the early eleventh century when the second wave of Christian expansion which
concerns us developed in the Far East.</p>
<p>Buddhism survived the onslaught much more successfully than
did Christianity. Even Manichaeism was not entirely suppressed, although in
order to survive it resorted to deceit. Manichaes began to pretend to be
Buddhists. At first, this was conscious mimicry; it was impossible, in fact, for
every convert to explain that he was entering a community, forbidden by the
government, disguised as Buddhist, but really Manichaen. Converts could not but
be repelled by such interpretations, and they would encourage betrayal. Thus,
passing themselves off as Buddhists and observing the appropriate decorum, the
Chinese Manichaes gradually fused with the Buddhists, and even such scholars as
Biruni ceased to distinguish them.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text58"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note58">[+58]</a></font>
This mixing was particularly intense in the regions where subsequently the
Tangut kingdom arose: Manichaen deities of the luminous heavens have been
discovered in Buddhist form on Qaraqoto icons.
 <a name="sik1text59"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note59">[+59]</a></p>
<p>So, as regards the struggle for their views of the world, the
influence of Chinese and Muslim cultures in the steppe was limited and was
halted by Byzantine culture understood in the broadest sense. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{42}
</font></b>And the most curious aspect of this phenomenon was the
fact that the success of &quot;steppe Byzantinism&quot;, i.e. the penetration of
the steppe by Christianity and Manichaeism, cannot be subsumed under the heading
of &quot;cultural influences&quot;. Any influence supposes some form of
compulsion, be it moral, intellectual or emotional. The nomads, however, were
always very sensitive to any form of compulsion and were able to beat it off
very successfully. The Byzantine Empire was far from the steppes of Central
Asia, it did not, and could not, put pressure on the nomads Furthermore, the
preaching of Christianity among the nomads was carried out by those who, in
Byzantium, were considered heretics. Therefore, the dissemination of
Christianity in the steppes was not a &quot;cultural influence&quot;, but a
transplanting of ideas.</p>
<p>The universahsm of Christianity, in which there is
&quot;neither barbarian, nor Scythian, nor Hellene, nor Jew&quot;, found
acceptance in the nomad world because it did not treat the nomads slightingly as
people of less than full value and did not lead to their subordination to a
foreign ruler, whether the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; or the &quot;Vice-regent of
the Prophet&quot;. On the contrary, though, the victory of &quot;Chinese
humanism&quot;,<font COLOR="#ff0000"> </font><font>  <a name="sik1text60"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note60">[+60]</a> </font>i.e.
the attempt by the Chinese to rid themselves of foreign elements in their
culture, resulted in violence to their defenceless subjects and so failed to
sweep across the Chinese Wall.</p>
<p>By 1000 Nestorianism had disappeared in China. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik1text61"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note61">[+61]</a></font>
The Song government declared a war of religion as such and conquered But whom? A
handful of monks and a few frontier half-breeds seeking consolation and peace.
The Chinese Nestonans who survived fled to the steppe, and from that moment
Nestorianism became an anti-Chinese force much more powerful than it had been
before the persecution.</p>
<p>Now let us pose a critical question is that really how we
should understand the fate of creeds and opinions? What sort of significance
does this have for the fall of China, the rise of Western Manchuria, for
abandoned Uighuria, for the influx into the Tangut kingdom? What will the study
of religious movements give us, rather than a critique of social and economic
relations which are only dealt with in passing in this work? It will give us
much, for ideological systems are nothing but an indicator of deep processes
-economic, social and ethnogenetic. Fantastic mythologies are foam <b><font COLOR="#943634">{43}
</font></b>on the wave, but it is by the foam that we judge the
depth of the river and the speed of the current. Of course, this is a roundabout
route. But what are we to do if the direct one is impassable for lack of
information? There is good reason for the tenth to eleventh centuries to be
called a &quot;dark&quot; age; it was entirely passed over in silence by the
chroniclers. Earlier we posed the problem of overcoming the falsity of the
sources, something, of course, not at all easy to do. But how can we tear aside
the veil of silence? How can we find a firm point for our investigation with a
complete absence of direct information? That is a task which is beyond the
capabilities of the inductive method.</p>
<p>Deduction gets its turn. If we gather the fragments of
information and locate them in space and in time, i.e. on the historical map and
in a synchronic table, the contours of the &quot;gaps&quot; will be narrowed and
the possibility of approximately completing them will appear. But for this it is
essential to observe the indicator, i.e. the fluctuating successes of the
religious advocacy of conflicting systems of thought and attitudes.</p>
<p>Next, let us pose a second, auxiliary problem: who is guilty
of this conspiracy of silence - historical reality itself which did not give
birth to events worth describing, or chroniclers who neglected their
responsibilities? The reply to this was given by Chinese historians as long ago
as 874. &quot;At this time China began to be shaken by anarchy [a reference to
the disturbances resulting in the fall of the Tang dynasty - L.G.] and had
little time to engage in foreign relations with neighbouring people [this
implies that geography, which flourished under the Tang thanks to active support
by a government with pretensions to hegemony over Asia, declined as soon as
these pretensions were not realised - L.G.], which is why the information of the
Chinese on the restoration of the House of Khoikhu [Uighuria] is brief and
fragmentary&quot;.<font COLOR="#ff0000">  <a name="sik1text62"></a><a href="sik1c.htm#sik1note62">[+62]</a></font>
Yet even after the restoration of order and centralisation in China - 960 -
information on the nomads is just as poor right down to the period of
Chingghiskhan. Our roundabout route gives us the possibility in part of filling
this lacuna in history. And this is how.</p>
<p>In the century 860-960, almost the cruellest one for China's
class society, there were frequent occasions when the individual's social
position changed, sometimes several times, in the course of his life. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{44}
</font></b>The demoted commander became a poor labourer, the
successful brigand became a prince, for a timely denunciation a servant became a
powerful feudal lord and, with a shift in power, became a peasant.</p>
<p>On the other hand, each individual, being alone, felt
defenceless. Since, at this time, adherence to the family or a particular
circle, or even to a political group, played no part, because betrayal had
become commonplace, each man needed to seek those close to him if only in
spirit. Entering a particular religious community he found himself among people
whom he could trust because he chose the community according to his tastes and
inclinations. Often such communities coincided with specific territorial and
political units. For example, the Buddhists tended towards Tangut or Khitan, the
Christians to Uighurs or Shato. In course of time, incorporation changed the
ethnic composition of the group out of recognition. That is why, when we compare
the ethnographic map of Asia in the ninth with that in the thirteenth century,
the first thing that strikes us is their lack of coincidence. Of course,
migration of tribes had also taken place over these three hundred years, but
this only affected the northern fringe of the Great Steppe; the ethnic
transformation of its mass took place as a result of the fortunes of history,
i.e. a logical change the mechanism of which we have sketched in outline.</p>
<p>But this mechanism itself gave rise to religious intolerance.
It was stimulated not by the dogmas of complex and elaborate theodicies, but by
simple hostility to another group of people, by personal relations, and then
extended to the whole system of religious views. Chinese nationalists, the
champions of Confucianism and enemies of any mysticism, including their own -
Tao - were particularly active in this regard. Let us see what they achieved.</p>

account that all the conquests of the Tang Empire, in the west and in the east,
were carried out by nomads who named the actual founder of the dynasty the
&quot;Tabghach (l e Toba) khan&quot; (see L N Gumilev, <i>Drevnie tyurki</i>,
221), since he was descended from Turkic stock (N.Ya. Bichurin, <i>Sobranie
svedenii o narodakh, </i>I, 355). Yet his successor, Gao-zong (650-83), very
rapidly lost what his father had achieved with such difficulty by returning to
the policy of traditional Chinese arrogance. The consequence was the creation of
the Second Turkic Kaganate (679-745) and China's loss of its now ephemeral
leadership in East Asia (G E Grumm-Grzhimailo, <i>Zapadnaya Mongoliya, </i>n,
218).</p>
<p><a name="sik1note39"></A><A HREF="sik1c.htm#sik1text39">[+39]</a> An Lushan, the son of a Sogdian and
a Turkic princess, made his career in the Tang army, rising from an ordinary
soldier to a general. In 756 he led a mutiny by three corps made up to strength
with nomads and which formed the strike-force of the army. After the movement
had been suppressed in 763, China was unable to continue an aggressive policy
and went over to the defence.</p>
