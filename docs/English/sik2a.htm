<h3>4. <a name="sik2para04"> The Dark Century (861-960)</a></h3>

<h4>End of a Century</h4>
<p>The history of Middle Asia is clear and understandable only
up to 861.  <a name="sik2text1"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note1">[+1]</a> Then, as a result of a fierce war,
all the states and powers of East Asia were obliged to restrict themselves to
their own territories. The Tibetans returned to their plateau; the Chinese
retreated behind their Wall, the Uighurs established themselves firmly in the
oases of the Western Territory,  <a name="sik2text2"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note2">[+2]</a> the Khitan  <a name="sik2text3"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note3">[+3]</a> ensured their independence by an eight tribe union in Western Manchuria
and the remnants of the Turkut settled in the Mountain Altai. The Great Steppe
became deserted and for half a century was the theatre of war between Uighurs
and Yenisei Kirghiz who had not managed to establish themselves there. Or
rather, they evidently did not particularly seek this. Used to a settled life in
the bountiful Minusinsk basin, the Kirghiz saw the Mongol steppes simply as a
place for military feats the aim of which was the spoils of war. When the desert
lay between the Kirghiz troops and the Uighur camps, the Uighur women and
children hid in the fortresses inherited from the Chinese military settlers, the
war became profitless to the Kirghiz and gradually died down, although it did
not officially cease.</p>
<p>The Uighurs quickly accustomed themselves to their new
homeland, where they mingled with the local population of the rich oases of Turf
an, Karashar and Kucha and transmitted their famous name to their descendants.
From the end of the ninth century it was the settled inhabitants of the Tianshan
foothills, essentially a new people, consisting of merchants, craftsmen and
cultivators, who<font COLOR="#943634"> <b>{48} </b></font>came to be called
Uighurs; this people in no way recalls the warlike nomads whose name it had
acquired and bore. The new state was officially recognised by China in 874,  <a name="sik2text4"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note4">[+4]</a> despite the defeat inflicted by the Tangut on the Uighurs.</p>
<p>Tianshan Uighuria stretched southwards to Lobnor, westwards
to the Manas and the Kucha oasis.  <a name="sik2text5"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note5">[+5]</a></p>
<p>Uighur legal documents published by S.E. Maslov show that
leasing, credit, the slave trade and debt slavery, taxes and dues, usury and
interest, formal deals and witnessed signatures existed in tenth- to
thirteenth-century Turfan.  <a name="sik2text6"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note6">[+6]</a> Uighur literature of
this period is rich only in translations. The Uighurs translated from Syriac,
Persian, Sanskrit, Chinese and Tibetan, but left almost nothing themselves.
Evidently there was such great intermingling that a hybrid culture was formed in
Turf an. The historical tradition of ancient Uighuria was broken.</p>
<p>The political history of the Uighurs at the end of the ninth
and beginning of the tenth century is obscure and unknown. There is vague
mention that the Uighurs took the towns of Aksu and Barskhan from the Karluk; in
the latter the ruler was a Karluk, but the inhabitants sided with the Dokuz-Oguz,
 <a name="sik2text7"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note7">[+7]</a> i.e. the Uighurs. But soon the Kirghiz took Aksu,
as a continuation of the war with the Uighurs, one must suppose, and Uighur
aggression to the west ceased.</p>
<p>Probably there was also an attempt to expand eastwards, since
Ganzhou again belonged to the Uighurs in 924.</p>
<p>Briefly, the Uighurs inherited the Chinese possessions of the
Western Territory and converted the forepost of Chinese penetration to the west
into a bulwark of Middle Asia both against the Muslim and against the Chinese,
both of whom grew steadily weaker.</p>
<p>The defeat of the Tibetan army in 861 was the last triumph of
the Tang Empire.  <a name="sik2text8"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note8">[+8]</a> From that time it decayed more
or less rapidly, but steadily. The Tabghach, the warlike frontier landholders
who set their own protege on the throne in 618, fused with the mass of the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{49}
</font></b>people over three hundred years, but the traditional Chinese never
sympathised with the Tang dynasty despite its advances to all classes of the
population. Ethnic psychology alone played no small part in that. Since the fall
of the Tang dynasty has been analysed economically, socially and politically
more than once and in detail,  <a name="sik2text9"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note9">[+9]</a> we shall dwell
only on the ethnopsychological factor which has been noted only by one author,
N.I. Konrad, who called this phenomenon &quot;the Chinese Renaissance&quot; or
&quot;humanism&quot;.  <a name="sik2text10"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note10">[+10]</a></p>
<p>Let us remember that the Tang emperors, seeking to create a
general Asiatic Empire, readily supported religions coming from the west:
Buddhism, Christianity and sometimes even Manichaeism. In the imperial theatre
at the Court Indian and Sogdian dancers, performing half-naked, achieved
success; to the true Chinese this seemed monstrously unseemly. One might think,
what importance could this have for officials who had a Confucian education if,
in its leisure time, the court diverted itself with exotic ideas and aesthetics;
but let us only recall our eighteenth-century Old Believers and their attitude
to decolletage. At different periods people feel and behave differently, and
imperial caprice shocked even loyal officials, pushing them towards acts of
opposition. Let us take just one case as an example:  <a name="sik2text11"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note11">[+11]</a> in
819 a bone supposed to be from the Buddha's finger was brought from India to
Chang'an, the luxurious capital of China. The Emperor himself took part in a
solemn ceremony to meet the relic and then the Confucian philosopher Han Yu
submitted a note in which he wrote: &quot;He, the Buddha, is dead, you know, and
long ago. This is only a rotten bone. How can it be in the palace? How can the
Son of Heaven worship dust?&quot; The philosopher fell into disgrace, but he
wrote knowing what was in store. The impulse of ethnic self-definition, a sort
of medieval chauvinism was stronger than good sense and the desire for a career.</p>
<p>It was not philosophy and ballet, but military reform which<b>
<font COLOR="#943634">{50} </font></b>impressed wider sections of the population
Turkish clothing and weapons were introduced into the army and, consequently,
the soldier's training was changed, i.e. his whole everyday style of life was
violated and reorganised. This was useful and even essential for war and
politics, but for the Chinese people, from the simple peasant to the grandee
official, it was foreign and offensive. Everything &quot;barbarian&quot; was so
odious for the ultra-patriots that even Taoism and eclectic Confucianism, which
showed patience with and interest in the world surrounding China, were also
unacceptable to them. For example, the founder of &quot;Chinese humanism&quot;
Han Yu writes &quot;What are we to do? I answer: If we do not hinder the
teachings of Lao Zi and the Buddha, our teaching will not spread. If we do not
put an end to the teachings of Lao Zi and the Buddha, we will achieve nothing.
If we turn their monks into lay persons, if we burn their books, if we convert
their temples and shrines into dwellings, if we explain the Way of the ancient
kings and thus take the people with us, if we care about lonely widows and
widowers, about orphans, about the incurably sick and cripples, this will be
close to what is needed &quot;  <a name="sik2text12"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note12">[+12]</a></p>
<p>In his treatise Han Yu bitterly complains that he is
&quot;only a professor&quot;  <a name="sik2text13"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note13">[+13]</a>and
has no access to power. Yet he is not quite right He succeeded in teaching a
whole generation of officials who, after his death, applied his principles in
practice.  <a name="sik2text14"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note14">[+14]</a> The results were not long delayed.</p>
<p>As soon as the imperial government welcomed this tendency, it
found itself to be in a vice so terrible that it could not escape. Warlike
generals were replaced by eunuch officials, they concentrated in their hands the
whole administrative power in the capital, as well as enormous wealth. In the
provinces military governors achieved the right to transmit their office to
their heirs and this made them independent of the central authority. Officials
received their posts after taking the examinations, but it was impossible to sit
for them without bribery or influential support. Parties struggling with one
another were formed, while taxes were exacted from the peasants as payment for
all these illegal activities. Everyone became dissatisfied and blood flowed.</p>
<p>In 859-60 in Zhejiang province the peasants, tormented by<b><font COLOR="#943634">
{51} </font></b>demands and punishments, rose in a revolt in which up to 30,000
took part It was only put down thanks to the fact that Uighurs and Tibetans,
seeking refuge in China from their steppe enemies, were mobilised into the
government forces In 868 soldiers in Guizhou rose in revolt and were joined by
many peasants, the insurgents seized part of the province of Anhui. The
government called out the forces of the Shato and Togon tribes and were again
victorious In 874 a new rising overwhelmed the whole of China Its leader, Huang
Chao, came from the family of a salt-trader who was too poor to enable his son
to take the examinations for office. The details of this rising relate entirely
to the history of China, but it is important for our subject that in 881 Huang
Chao took Chang'an and proclaimed himself Emperor. With the title he accepted a
heavy inheritance - the deep moral decay of the officials, the limitations of
the poor peasantry, the treachery of the military commanders In 882 one of his
associates, Zhu Wan, betrayed the cause of the rising and accepted from the
hands of the Tang emperor the rank of jiedushi, military governor. This gave the
government forces a breathing space during which a turning point occurred, the
nomads entered the war.</p>
<p>The Shato Turks, the last descendants of the Hun, lived for a
long time in Dzungaria, participating in the Tibetan-Uighur wars until, because
of differences with the Tibetans, they entered the possessions of the Middle
Empire. From 878 they settled in Ordos. Not understanding too much about the
deep causes for the Tang Empire's degeneration, they recalled that this dynasty
for three centuries, despite the will of its officials, had been well-disposed
to the steppe peoples and saw them as people, not as wild animals. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik2text15"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note15">[+15]</a>
</font>Therefore, at a critical moment, without thinking, they came to its aid.
The Tangut, with whom we shall deal below, did the same.</p>
<p>Li Keyong, the young leader of the Shato,  <a name="sik2text16"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note16">[+16]</a>
proved to be a talented general In the spring of 883 his troops, supported by
the Tangut, defeated the rebels at the river Wei, drove them from the capital
and pursued them, cutting down the fugitives Seventeen thousand Shato were
enough to break the main forces of Huang Chao In 884 he committed suicide, his
force was dispersed and became partisan detachments which resisted the
government forces<b><font COLOR="#943634"> {52} </font></b>till 901. But the
strength and attraction of the Tang dynasty was not restored. As soon as the
eunuch officials attempted to renew the old system two military governors
carried out a <i>coup d'etat. </i>In 907 the last Tang monarch, the minor, Ai-di,
was overthrown, the eunuchs killed and the double traitor Zhu Wen seized power,
declaring himself emperor of a new dynasty, the Late Liang. A new period in
China's history started from this point; this bears the title of the Five
Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>New Rhythms</h4>
<p>In describing the period which started in 907, the historian
Andre Cordier writes: &quot;it has to be acknowledged that this period in the
history of China is of only middling interest. These leaders who thirsted for
the imperial title, having no right to it other than the seizure of their
neighbours&quot; lands, moved merely by pride, advantage and military prowess
without a common idea, coarse, uneducated, superstitious people, fearing nothing
other than witchcraft and sorcery, they recall the barons of our feudalism, real
predators tracking down their prey to throw themselves on it at the opportune
moment, robbing town and country for the booty they accumulated in their
castles. Not a single social idea, nor a single moral one, nothing noble, only
brute force was the means and plunder and murder the aim of their actions. If
they refrained from brutality, it was not from true religious feelings, but from
terror of the supernatural forces they did not understand, but whose influence
they greatly feared&quot;.  <a name="sik2text17"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note17">[+17]</a></p>
<p>In this description something has been caught faithfully, but
the author also failed to note something, looking at events too closely to catch
the general pattern. It is scarcely helpful to observe the starry firmament in a
microscope. Therefore, we shall deliberately omit a whole series of details
which hide the perspective and concentrate attention on the intertwining threads
of historical fortunes which condemned China to an unheard of humiliation and
the Great Steppe to neglect and conversion into desert, while new states,
menacing but ephemeral, arose on both its eastern and western borders; for it
was this distribution of forces that was characteristic of the &quot;dark&quot;
period of Asia's history.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{53}</font></b> From the 890s regions of the Yangzi basin
began to fall away from the central government, and when the dynasty changed the
whole of southern China refused obedience to the new authority. Nine sovereign
states were formed in the south, since the rulers of nine regions took the title
of <i>wang </i>(king) and <i>di </i>(emperor). On the other hand, in the north
the new emperor impressed many influential people. Treacherous and dissolute,
deprived both of high intellect and of administrative talent, cowardly on the
field of battle, he completely suited his associates, they did not differ from
him at all and hoped that, with such a ruler, they too might give rein to their
foul instincts. Therefore, no one stood up for the Tang dynasty apart from the
Shato whose leader, the &quot;one-eyed dragon&quot; Li Keyong, declared war on
the usurper.</p>
<p>Li Keyong relied on the help of the Khitan leader, Ye-lu
Ambagan (Ye-lu A-bao-ji), with whom he had concluded an alliance in 905, but he
betrayed him and proposed an alliance to Zhu Wen which the emperor proudly
refused, deciding that he would suppress the rebellion even without the help of
a savage. He then moved two huge armies against the small Ordos, these were
scattered by Li Keyong. The Shato went onto the offensive and, despite the death
of their leader in 908, were again victorious Li Congke, the son of the
&quot;one-eyed dragon&quot; and who was of no less prowess than his father,
finished the war successfully by 923 and restored the Tang empire Since he
himself took the throne the dynasty is known as the Later Tang.  <a name="sik2text18"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note18">[+18]</a></p>
<p>Again we see that it was not only the military leaders&quot;
ambition and greed that was the cause of war and the rum of China. No, the
struggle between the Chinese nationalists who had supported the Liang dynasty
and the nomads who had been Sinicized, though not completely so, who went into
battle for the idea of the Tang dynasty continued. The line of this struggle
passes like a red thread through the whole history of China in the period of the
Five Dynasties.</p>
<p>Only by this can one explain the bitterness shown during the
war, and even during its last days. One of the Liang commanders, wounded and
taken prisoner, rejected the offer by his victor of mercy and high office if he
sided with the Later Tang He preferred execution.  <a name="sik2text19"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note19">[+19]</a>
One can hardly explain such conduct as egoism Evidently the Chinese had
something to fight against, but Cordier is<b> {54}</b>
right on another point: there also has to be something to fight for, and this
was what was missing. At that time &quot;the soldiers, as if out of mischief,
killed one commander and put forward another&quot;.  <a name="sik2text20"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note20">[+20]</a>
The positive programme of the Chinese chauvinists was the Utopia of the
disciples of the &quot;humanist&quot; Han Yu, but although the Shato had no
treatises in literary form they had the nomad traditions inherited even from the
Hun. Apart from that, not yet having lost their links with the steppe, they
attracted the Tatab, Khitan, Tatar and Togon to their banner.  <a name="sik2text21"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note21">[+21]</a> All these tribes had, in their time, been offended by the Chinese. They
took no prisoners and themselves did not surrender. That was why they won.</p>
<p>Even the Khitan diversion undertaken by Ye-lu Ambagan in 921
could not change the situation at the front. Ambagan was routed and scarcely
retained his own possessions, particularly since far from all his fellow
tribesmen agreed with him. Of course, here too we see lust for power and greed,
stubbornness and vanity, but these emotions noted by Cordier found their
expression somewhat differently in China, Manchuria, Ordos and Tibet. People are
not pawns on a chess board; they struggle better or worse according to certain
nuances they do not themselves perceive, but the historian has no right not to
perceive them. Indomitability became the banner of the age, and so the war
continued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>A Third Force</h4>
<p>The Khitan were a warlike, though not numerous, people. They
belonged to the south-east branch of the Mongol-speaking tribes -the descendants
of the Xian-bi - and occupied the steppe part of western Manchuria from the
river Nonni in the north to the Liao He in the south. At first they were hunters
and fishers, but in the seventh to ninth centuries they acquired the skills of
cattle-herding from the Turks and borrowed those of agriculture from the
Chinese. Without the resources for an independent policy, they were sometimes
subject to the Turks and Uighurs, sometimes passed under the authority of the
Tang empire only, a few years later, to secede again. However, in the second
half of the ninth century, when steppe Uighuria fell and then the rising of
Huang Chao bled the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{55} </font></b>Tang power white,
the Khitan turned out to be the strongest and most united people of East Asia.
The Khitan power was a union of eight tribes ruled by a common leader chosen for
three years. History shows that, in fact, this term was not observed. Energetic
leaders either perished sooner than it, or continued to make war after it.
Nevertheless, such a law existed in principle.</p>
<p>The numerous hunting tribes of the Shivei, ancestors of the
Tatars, bordered the Khitan on the north. The Tatab, whom the Chinese called
Kumokhi or Xi (Chinese Si), lived in the west, bordering the steppes of present
day Mongolia up to lake Dalai-Nur. The Shivei and Tatab were Mongol-speaking
people and formed a single ethnic mass with the Khitan. The hunting tribes of
the Jurchen (Manchur) dwelt to the east of the Khitan. Here, too, was the Bokhai
kingdom which included a mixture of various Korean and Manchurian tribes
amalgamated by a civilisation of Korean type.  <a name="sik2text22"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note22">[+22]</a>
In the south the Khitan bordered China and, with varying success, continually
carried on a small but bloody war with the Chinese on the frontier.</p>
<p>At the start of the tenth century, one of the eight leaders, Yelu Ambagan, was particularly active. After becoming chief leader in his turn,
in 903 he made successful raids on the Jurchen and China's north-east frontier,
strengthening his forces with Tatab who had joined him. In 904 he repeated his
incursion into China, attacking the You region of Hebei and the Amur Shivei.
From 905 Ye-lu Ambagan, bought by Zhu Wen, involved himself in the Chinese civil
war, at first on the side of the Turkic Shato, then, in 907, on the side of the
Liang dynasty.</p>
<p>After accepting luxurious gifts, however, Ambagan did not
hasten to the aid of his ally. He preferred the easier war with his Manchurian
neighbours, the Tatab and Jurchen. In 906 he struck them a powerful blow, at the
same time plundering the Chinese You region. Thanks to this he achieved
popularity with the troops and was enable to carry out a <i>coup d'etat </i>in
907 which Machiavelli himself would have approved for its method. The point was
that, according to custom. Ye-lu Ambagan had served as leader for three years
and should be replaced.</p>
<p>He then gathered the other leaders in a council and cut off
their heads which were then set on the frontier. He declared himself <b><font COLOR="#943634">{56}
</font></b>&quot;Heavenly Emperor&quot;, his wife &quot;Heavenly Empress&quot;  <a name="sik2text23"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note23">[+23]</a>
and continued his conquests, subduing the Shivei and Wuwan tribes in Northern
Manchuria and the Jurchen in the Maritime region.</p>
<p>Ambagan's further activities amounted to subordinating
neighbouring tribes. The Tatab submitted in 911, the Amur Ugi in 915, but final
victory over the forest people was only achieved at the end of 919. In 912
Ambagan attempted to take Hebei where the military commander Liu Shou-kuang took
it into his head to declare himself emperor. This attempt failed only because
his own brothers rose against Ambagan. A year later they were seized, but the
campaign did not succeed and meanwhile the Shato claimant, Li Congke, conquered
Hebei and captured the usurper Liu Shou-kuang.</p>
<p>Gathering his forces, Ye-lu Ambagan undertook in 916 an
attempt to pacify the west - the Turks (Shato), Duhun` (evidently the Uighur Hun
tribe who had settled in Chinese possessions after the defeat of Uighuria) and
the Dansyan (of whom we shall have much to say later). According to a Khitan
court history, the <i>Liao-shi, </i>he succeeded, but in fact he suffered defeat
by the Shato and took himself off to Manchuria.  <a name="sik2text24"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note24">[+24]</a>
Afterwards the Khitan actively waged war against the Shato, but in a somewhat
strange fashion: they plundered and drove into slavery the population of Hebei
which consisted not of Shato, but of Chinese. The Shato, standing out against
the Khitan, stood as defenders of the Chinese peasants against fierce
barbarians. Thus, Ambagan, without wishing it, helped the triumph of the Shato
forces and the restoration of the Tang Empire in the form of the Later Tang
which took place in 923.</p>
<p>Unsuccessful in the south, Ambagan decided to compensate
himself in the steppe. In 924 with a strong force he marched west against the
Togon, Dansyan and Zubu.  <a name="sik2text25"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note25">[+25]</a> We may suppose that he
sought to seize the possessions of his antagonist - the Later Tang Empire - <b><font COLOR="#943634">{57}
</font></b>from the north and press the Shato to strictly Chinese territory. The
description of the campaign in the Liao dynasty history is scarcely
intelligible. We are told there was a battle by Sukum mountain, but it is
unclear where this mountain was and with whom the battle was; a separate
detachment was sent against the Zubu commanded by a prince of the blood. The
prince and his troop plundered the whole region occupied by the Zubu and
conquered the tribes on the Khomushe (the Humusi) (?!) and Feotutshan peaks.  <a name="sik2text26"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note26">[+26]</a></p>
<p>If we hypothetically suppose that Khomushe is Qamar-daban, it
turns out that the Khitan forces devastated the whole of Eastern Mongolia before
they reached the ruins of the Uighur capital, Karabalgasun. Ye-lu Ambagan
ordered an inscription to be carved in stone there commemorating his feat and
returned without even leaving a garrison in the devastated steppe. There was no
one to guard it against and no reason to do so. No one wanted it. So Ambagan's
forces penetrated to the south of the steppe to Cuanzhou where they captured the
<i>tutuk </i>(official) of the town, the Uighur Bilge. The prisoner was released
to the Uighur <i>idykut </i>(title of a ruler) with a letter in which Ambagan
proposed that the Uighurs should return to their homeland, i.e. the Orkhon
valley, since he did not mind whether these lands belonged to the Khitan or the
Uighurs. The ruler of Uighuria refused, referring to the fact that his people
were accustomed to the new homeland and satisfied with what they had.  <a name="sik2text27"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note27">[+27]</a>
The Kirghiz likewise had no claim on the steppe. They had long ago left it and
departed to the bountiful Minusinsk basin where they were able to lead a settled
life, engage in agriculture and livestock farming, but were not nomadic.</p>
<p>Is it not strange that the steppe, an apple of discord
between powerful peoples until the ninth century, suddenly ceased to interest
neighbouring powers in the tenth? This question is so important that we shall
pay particular attention to it.  <a name="sik2text28"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note28">[+28]</a></p>
<p>The conquest of the Bokhai kingdom was Ye-lu Ambagan's last <b><font COLOR="#943634">{58}
</font></b>success.  <a name="sik2text29"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note29">[+29]</a> Early in 926 the government
put itself at the mercy of the conqueror, and in the autumn a rising by the
population was put down. The Khitan exterminated the royal house, took the
aristocracy to their capital and sent the ordinary people in masses to the
uninhabited regions, uprooting them from their homes. Ye-lu Ambagan died at the
beginning of 927 leaving his heir, Deguang, not the illusory authority of a
leader over a tribal union, but the throne of a large kingdom which had called
itself an empire from 916. This newborn empire had much strength and not a few
enemies.</p>
<p>The Shato were still the most dangerous opponents of the
Khitan. After the defeat of the Liang dynasty, all the south China rulers of
regions transferred their allegiance to the renewed Tang dynasty, with the
exception of the Shu kingdom (in Sichuan). There were 30,000 troops in Shu, but
when the Tang forces arrived in 925 they gave in without fighting. The southern
Chinese had forgotten how to fight. But they had not forgotten how to slander
and the Tang emperor Li Congke, on the basis of the slanders of those around
him, executed his most faithful companions. Only the military leader Li Siyuan
escaped. He raised a rebellion against the court eunuchs and favourites. In 926
the troops went over to his side and his own favourites killed the emperor; on
entering the capital, Li Siyuan transferred them elsewhere, thus establishing
order. Ambagan wanted to make use of his neighbour's troubles and retained the
Shato emissary, demanding the concession of Hebei from the Later Tang Empire,
but he was refused.  <a name="sik2text30"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note30">[+30]</a> It became clear from this
time that a clash between the two Sinicized barbarian empires was inevitable,
but Ambagan's death delayed the conflict.</p>
<p>Now, after looking around, we have the right to pose an
important question: how are we to regard the Khitan state (in the full sense of
this word) - as the heir of the nomad powers of Central Asia, or as a peripheral
variant of the Chinese empire? The Chinese themselves considered the Khitan
barbarians. Wittfogel, in the work already cited, considers them so Sinicized
that he combined them in a single cultural circle with China as a provincial
empire of which there were then ten. The only distinguishing feature of the
Khitan empire, which received the Chinese name of Liao, was that it <b><font COLOR="#943634">{59}
</font></b>remained an independent state to the end, while all the others were
swallowed up by the national Chinese Song empire in the second half of the tenth
century. Was this so?</p>
<p>First of all, we must reject the idea that the Khitan kingdom
continued, or tried to continue, the traditions of the kaganates. From a
primitive tribal union Khitan became, not a military democratic <i>elem</i>,  <a name="sik2text31"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note31">[+31]</a><i>
</i>but a feudal empire. Not cattle raising, but agriculture became the basic
occupation of the population. Writing was borrowed from China, i.e. hieroglyphs
were adapted to the agglutinative Mongol language.  <a name="sik2text32"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note32">[+32]</a> To
the traditional rejection of Chinese ideology and system of education, a feature
of all the steppe dwellers, the Khitan counterposed the acquisition of Chinese
culture, winning the services of learned Chinese, and they reinforced this
process by the accretion of Bokhai and part of Northern China (Youzhou, now
Beijing). It seems that K. Wittfogel is right. But this is not yet all.</p>
<p>The Khitan government carried out a policy of enforced
Siniciz-ation and strove to eliminate the remnants of the clan and tribal system
and break the power of the tribal aristocracy. Wide sections of Khitan society
opposed this policy - aristocrats, people and the tribes included in the state.
They either rose with weapons in hand, or simply refused to wear Chinese style
dress and learn Chinese characters. It reached the point where, alongside the
Emperor's Chinese palace, there was the empress's court at which Khitan custom
was observed.  <a name="sik2text33"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note33">[+33]</a> A gulf appeared between the
authorities and the people in Khitan. The authorities held the initiative in
policy, but the people managed to remain themselves. Both Chinese and steppe
Turks were equally foreign to the Khitan people.</p>
<p>The moist but cold climate of Manchuria and the Maritime
region determined a particular landscape in these lands, known to the Russian
reader from V. K. Arsenev's splendid descriptions. The Mongol, Manchurian and
Korean tribes adapted themselves wonderfully to their moist forests and full
rivers, as well as to the valleys between the mountains and volcanoes which
afforded people a livelihood. In the tenth century the economy of the Far <b><font COLOR="#943634">{60}
</font></b>East peoples as we shall call them, as distinct from Chinese and
steppe dwellers, was on the rise. Then the possibility of conquest arose, for
those remaining at home could easily feed those in the forces.</p>
<p>There were those to be fought, and for some reason! The Tang
Middle Empire had seized Liaodong and Korea and envisaged further schemes, for
Central Manchuria. All the tribes from the Sungari to the Amur were threatened
with enslavement that could only be avoided by combining. Ye-lu Ambagan simply
guessed, or, perhaps, understood, where events were leading and seized the
initiative.</p>
<p>So, in our opinion, the Khitan state was the van of a
particular Far East ethno-cultural complex. It was a fantastic interweaving of
the traditions of various tribes and peoples: agricultural (Bokhai), hunting (Jurchen
and Shivei), cattle raising (Tatab), and fishing (Ugi), more or less influenced
by the Chinese and the nomad Turks. But we should regard this complex not as a
periphery of China or the Great Steppe, but as a &quot;third force&quot; for the
first time appearing on the stage of world history in the tenth century. China
resisted the Khitan as far as it was able, but the Great Steppe was silent. Why?</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Rains Intervene in History</h4>
<p>Anticipating the investigation, we have given a brief
geographical description of the territory lying between the Great Wall and the
huge green barrier of the Siberian taiga which borders the steppes on the north.
In the &quot;dark&quot; period with which we are concerned both these barriers
were broken. On the one hand, the Central Asian nomads, the Khitan, penetrated
into China and settled there, leaving their native steppes; and on the other,
the ancestors of the Yakuts, the Kurykan, moved into Siberia.</p>
<p>While the migration of the Khitan fails to evoke the
immediate question: why? (after all, the majority of historians do not know the
delight of the steppes), the transfer to Siberia demanded an explanation. At
first glance it seems that here is a violation of the principle in accordance
with which a people seeks to settle in a landscape similar to that in which it
was formed. But no, the Kurykan migration took place along the great river Lena
on rafts borne by the current and the Kurykan settled on the bordering meadows
and in the valleys fringing the clear lakes. However, all the beauties of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{61}
</font></b>northern nature failed to make good the loss of the fragrant steppes
of the Baikal region conceded by the Kurykan to the Buryats who, in their turn,
had left the even drier Trans-Baikal area.  <a name="sik2text34"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note34">[+34]</a></p>
<p>Let us recall that it was then, too, that the Pechenegs left
the Aral steppes and the Karluk the Balkhash ones. It looks as if we have here
no simple coincidence, but a regular phenomenon characteristic of Central Asia
in the tenth century.</p>
<p>So, we see the consequences, but the causes are obscure. Of
course, the simplest thing is to declare that development occurred and the
peoples began to behave differently. Yet it is true and indisputable that social
development depends on economic progress, on technical improvements, and what
improvements can there be in a herding economy? There is no reason to change the
form of the whip or the lasso. So what, then - stagnation?</p>
<p>Nevertheless, changes took place, and their scale was not
less, but greater than those in settled agricultural lands, provided, of course,
we compare equal time spans; for example, century with century. That is the
method in the natural sciences when comparing functional dependence and there is
no reason to forego this fruitful method in relation to series of historical
events united in a causal sequence. This is the basis on which we shall try to
solve the problem.</p>
<p>In East Asia the Pacific monsoons are the analogue of the
Atlantic cyclones and change their track in just the same way. Sometimes they
carry moisture to Mongolia; then, the Gobi is restricted, the slopes of Hentei
are covered with trees and Baikal is full of water. Sometimes, moving to the
north, they precipitate their moisture on the Yablonovoi range and it flows back
through the Amur; and, in the third case, they water Kamchatka. The periods of
the passage of the monsoons coincide chronologically with the tracking of the
cyclones through the western steppes. The level of Baikal which is 50% supplied
from the steppes through the Selenga is proof of this. It is found in opposition
to the Caspian and coinciding with the Aral and Balkhash.  <a name="sik2text35"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note35">[+35]</a> Despite the fact that archaeological work around Baikal has not aimed at
establishing the historical <b><font COLOR="#943634">{62} </font></b>fluctuations
in its level, we are able, nevertheless, to define more precisely the periods of
steppe desiccation because the history of the Caspian is well known. Thanks to
the regularities noted, it is easy to conclude that a period of increased
moisture in the steppes in the ninth century was succeeded by a dry period
ending early in the eleventh century. At this time there took place the
emigration of the Turkic peoples from the steppes to its borders and the
contrary settlement of the steppe by the Amur peoples, the ancestors of the
Mongols and the Mongol-speaking Tatars, who acquired a rich, new region,
multiplied and grew in strength.</p>
<p>A review of the historical facts in this regard shows that
the geographical setting, determining the natural circumstances, had a colossal
part to play in the historical development of the peoples in the forest-steppe
zone in Eurasia and was sometimes a decisive factor in the fate of mighty
states. At times the talents and feats of rulers were unable to save their
peoples from destruction, while in other cases mediocre khans were in a position
to maintain the might of their hordes. Of course, the talent and might of
leaders, other things being equal, were very significant, but the fate of the
peoples in the forest-steppe zone in Eurasia was decided by rain and green
grass.</p>
<p>Apart from the similarity of geographic conditions in the
western and eastern borders of the Eurasian steppe which we have noted, a real
difference of cardinal importance for us is also to be seen: the seasonality of
moisture.</p>
<p>In the west, as far as the Altai and the Tianshan, an almost
complete absence of summer precipitation and the winter influence of the
Atlantic cyclones is a feature. This means that the steppe burns up in summer,
but in winter is covered with such a thick layer of snow that livestock cannot
get through it. Moreover, frequent warm spells are associated with the cyclones;
these cause bare ice to form and then the animals perish wholesale. Therefore,
the nomads use the steppes for a spring bite, but herd the animals into the
hills for the summer; there there are luxuriant alpine meadows in the valleys
between the ranges. For winter they prepare hay.</p>
<p>Each of the mountain valleys belongs to a particular clan, so
the local nomads spend the greater part of the year in their own circle. Thus,
the custom of extensive social exchange does not arise among them. They always
avoided combining into large hordes, preferring unions of tribes or clans;
consequently their part in world history has <b><font COLOR="#943634">{63} </font></b>amounted
to a defence against external enemies, and this has rarely been successful.
 <a name="sik2text36"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note36">[+36]</a></p>
<p>Moreover, the presence of mountains, in places crowned with
glaciers, of slopes, sometimes covered with dense woods, sometimes scorched by
the burning sun (depending on whether it was a northward or southward facing
slope), numerous mountain springs and streams created exceedingly favourable
conditions for the Sayan-Altai and Tianshan nomads compared with the severely
continental conditions of Mongolia. Yet the pulse of history beat in the east of
the steppe, not here.</p>
<p>In Mongolia the monsoons bring moisture in summer; the centre
of an enormous anti-cyclone hangs over the steppe in winter. In winter there are
clear, sunny days and quiet, windless weather. Light winds only occur at the
edges of the anti-cyclone. So little snow falls that livestock can be on pasture
the year round, and on the borders of the Gobi the snow fallen during the night
does not melt, but evaporates (owing to insulation) with the dawn.</p>
<p>In summer Central Asia is heated by the sun and a
continental, tropical air results, but there is enough rain to maintain the
vegetational cover and livestock find themselves enough to eat even in the
valleys. The herds and herdsmen are on the pastures the year round and encounter
one another. Therefore, the custom of constant exchanges with one another on a
wide scale arises among the eastern nomads; this makes it possible for them to
combine and actively repel the pressure of their sedentary neighbours, of whom
the most dangerous was the Chinese empire. Chinese strength exceeded that of the
Hun twenty times and that of the Turkut fifty times, but the nomads&quot;
cohesion and ability to organise, evoked by their daily life, afforded them
victory over their terrible enemy.</p>
<p>If this is so, the absence of a powerful military power in
the steppe meant either a complete lack of population or its extreme paucity. As
has been shown above, the number of people in the steppe is limited by the
amount of water. So, the fact that the written sources mention no state on the
territory of Mongolia in the tenth century is evidence of the formation here of
desert, and as soon as the monsoons returned to their southern track new peoples
and new powers <b><font COLOR="#943634">{64} </font></b>began to arise in the
steppe whose history was immediately noted by their neighbours  <a name="sik2text37"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note37">[+37]</a>.
This occurred in the eleventh century.</p>
<p>We have closed the chain of analysis, doing it in two ways,
and reached the same conclusion. This means it is reliable Our task now is to
show how this conclusion can be used.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Competitors</h4>
<p>While prior to the tenth century the key to understanding the
history of Central Asia was the struggle we have outlined between China and the
Great Steppe, now the situation had changed radically. Chinese society had
fallen a victim of social crisis and was so demoralised that it was unable to
repulse the attack of the Shato tribe, few in numbers, foreign to the Chinese in
blood, language and culture. The Great Steppe was turned into a desert. The
southern nomads added to the forces of the Shato prince, the northern ones took
shelter on the borders of the Siberian taiga, while the former Turkic and Hun
nomad lands were pastured by wild camels and Przhewalsky horses able to cover
hundreds of kilometres merely to quench their thirst at springs which had not
yet dried up.</p>
<p>The strength of the peoples of Manchuria appeared against
this background, for them the reduction in precipitation was a benefit since
their climate was moist enough and fewer floods and less luxuriant vegetation
was only of advantage to agriculture. This increase in strength should not be
regarded as absolute. No, the strength of the Manchunan tribes united by the
Khitan empire remained as it had been, but their competitors and enemies grew
weaker so that the Khitan had the chance to claim hegemony in East Asia.</p>
<p>The greatest hindrance to the Khitan empire was its own
failure to overcome the past - its tribal existence. Not only the Amur and
Maritime area tribes of hunters and fishers (Shivei, Tile, Ugi, Jurchen), not
only the agricultural population of Central Manchuria (Bokhai), but also many
members of the eight tribe Khitan union failed to understand the need to
sacrifice life and freedom for the greatness of Ye-lu's dynasty Even in the
king's family unity was lacking After Ambagan's death the empress, using her
influence <b><font COLOR="#943634">{65} </font></b>over the troops (women
occupied an exceedingly high position among the Khitan and had a deciding voice
in all matters other than military), placed on the throne her favourite,
Deguan's youngest son.  <a name="sik2text38"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note38">[+38]</a> The legal heir, the
eldest, Duyu, was forced to flee to the Shato, to the Later Tang Empire, i.e. to
seek help from his country's enemy. But what else could he do? Perhaps commit
suicide?</p>
<p>The Turkic Shato were in quite a different situation. They
won a brilliant victory in 923 using the remaining strength of the nomads from
the desiccating Great Steppe. With this, though, the steppe reserves failed, and
to keep the multi-million people in obedience the Chinese themselves had to be
brought into the administration. We have seen that Li Congke, the founder of the
dynasty, paid with his life for his predilection for the Chinese theatre (actors
became the emperor's favourites and received state posts) and his trust in the
eunuch officials Li Siyuan, the new emperor, an illiterate, but brave and
intelligent. Turk of noble character, clashed both with this problem and with a
new one, still more complex, insoluble even. The Shato officers appointed by the
rulers of the southern regions willy-nilly found themselves in a Chinese
environment and imperceptibly, gradually started to behave like Chinese
officials, the only difference being that they did not have even simple
literacy. To win the battle was easier than to realise that success.</p>
<p>The domination of Southern China by central authority was
purely nominal, but it was impossible to achieve even that. Thus, in 927 an
inspector sent to Shu (Sichuan) to carry out a census was executed by the
region's ruler, then regional administrations began to be acquired by military
force, as under feudalism Making use of the confusion, the ruler of Wu
(south-east China) declared himself emperor. A rising in the north-east was
still more dangerous, here the ruler, Wang Du, fearing that he would be deposed,
seceded and appealed to Khitan for help This evoked open war between the Shato
and Khitan, or between the empires of the Later Tang and Liao.</p>
<p>The Shato were victorious The rebel and his allies were
besieged in the fortress of Dingzhou. Some townsman opened the gates and the
fortress fell Wang Du was burnt in his house which had been fired by the
conquerors, the Khitan leader surrendered, was taken in chains to the capital
and executed <b><font COLOR="#943634">{66}</font></b> In 929 the Khitan replied
to their defeat by an incursion into Shanxi (Shansi), but retreated as a result
of many losses in killed and captured. The Shato were unable to build on their
success, since Shu again seceded and the officers of their own army rose in
revolt there. An attempt to put them down ended in defeat for the government
forces and the war only died out in 931 when the cause of the rising, a minister
unacceptable to the troops was executed.</p>
<p>The Shato were supplied with enough money and people for
defence, but not for attack, and they sought peace with the Khitan. So, in 931
they returned all their prisoners, retaining only their most famous officer, Zhe
La. The Khitan, though, seizing the opportunity, devastated the north-eastern
regions of China. The emperor then appointed as ruler of Hedong (the territory
east of the Huang He bend) the most able Shato commander, Shi Jintang, but this
displeased the governor of You (Beijing) and he surrendered the town and region
to the Khitan in 932.</p>
<p>Two misfortunes occurred in 933: Shu again seceded and its
ruler proclaimed himself emperor; the ruler of the town of Xiazhou in Gansu died
leaving a son who was a minor. The emperor wished to appoint a new ruler for
Xiazhou, but the town did not accept him and withstood a siege by the regular
army. Ten thousand Dansyan  <a name="sik2text39"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note39">[+39]</a> arrived from the
steppe to help the rebels; they devastated the country, smashed the Tang Army
and, cutting down the fugitives, drove it to complete destruction. The emperor
was compelled to recognise the rebel ruler. It is difficult to say to what such
an unbelievable defeat might not have led, had not the Khitan, disturbed by the
growth in Dansyan strength, sent a powerful army against them;  <a name="sik2text40"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note40">[+40]</a>
although this did not achieve the desired results, it deflected the Dansyan
troops into the steppe to defend their settlements. The Later Tang empire was
saved, but, alas, by its mortal enemy.</p>
<p>Even the iron constitution of Li Siyuan could not withstand
this, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{67} </font></b>but as soon as he fell ill his
eldest son introduced troops into the palace to assure himself of the throne.
The sick emperor's grandson, Li Congke, came to his defence and was driving the
claimant from the palace with the help of loyal troops. During the skirmish the
rebel prince was killed and the emperor expired.</p>
<p>Coming to the throne, Li Congke attempted to set the
administration in good order and, to do this, to transfer several governors to
other posts. They were accustomed to their familiar places and refused to obey.
An adopted son of the dead emperor headed the rising, a Chinese named Wang who,
on being adopted, was called Li Congke. He ruled on the western frontier where
there were many troops guarding against Dansyan and Tibetan attacks. Li Congke
moved with these troops against Loyang without meeting resistance. How could
this happen?</p>
<p>There is no direct answer or analysis of these events in the
history of China, but let us recall that the best, Shato, troops were
concentrated on the north-east frontier commanded by the Shato Shi Jintang,
withstanding the thrust of the Khitan. The Chinese forces, though, saw in the
pretender their fellow countryman. That is all. In 934 the legal emperor was
taken prisoner and strangled, and the rebel Wang took the throne. Finally, a
Chinese appeared at the head of the Chinese empire and the whole country
submitted to him, including Shi Jintang and his Shato troops.</p>
<p>The first thing the new emperor did was to establish a system
for shadowing the regional rulers. The Chinese governors put up with this,
because each of them knew that, had he been emperor, he would have done the
same. But for a Turk such a system seemed unnatural and unbearable. Shi Jintang
informed Wang that he did not consider adoption a real relationship and proposed
to hand power to the legal heir, the son of the strangled Li Conghou. In answer
to this ultimatum Wang executed two sons of Shi Jintang who were at the court
and moved his forces against Hedong. Then Shi Jintang opened the frontier and
invited Khitan aid, recognising the Khitan emperor as his &quot;father&quot;
which, in the terminology of the time, indicated the relationship of a subject
to his sovereign. Fifty thousand Khitan passed through the fortified passage of
Yaimen without loosing a single arrow and in 936 on the valleys of Shanxi they
turned the Chinese army to flight.</p>
<p>After this, Deguan detached sixteen areas from China,
including Yu (Beijing), left Shi Jintang five thousand horsemen and allowed <b><font COLOR="#943634">{68}
</font></b>him to finish the war, which he did The Shato and Khitan invested
Loyang, where the usurper had hidden In order not to fall into enemy hands the
latter burnt himself in his house along with his family, this ended the war.</p>
<p>The new dynasty was called the Later Jin, named after the
first principality founded by the Shato after the defeat of Huang Chao's rising
The princes of Jin had been the famous &quot;One-eyed Dragon&quot; Li Keyong and
his son, Li Congke, before he became, to his misfortune, emperor. The choice of
the name tells of a return to Turkic traditions, among which was union with the
Khitan against China Yet, nevertheless, this was not a Turkic empire The greater
part of the non-Sinicized Turkic Shato continued to engage in nomadism north of
the Great Wall, and the overwhelming majority of the subjects of the Later Jin
were Chinese. One can only ignore one's own subjects if one has great strength
Shi Jintang acquired that by the alliance with the Khitan whose vassal his
empire became.</p>
<p>Thus, Khitan became the leader of Eastern Asia, but not so
much thanks to its prowess as to the demoralisation of its southern, the
scarcity of its western and the disorganisation of its north-eastern neighbours.
But the most significant event of this period was that part of the ancient
Chinese lands, though an insignificant one, came under the power of foreigners.
This determined the course of history for many centuries ahead.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Liao Empire</h4>
<p>Shi Jintang had saved his life by going over to the enemy,
but no more than that. He was a vassal to the Khitan Deguang, despite the
splendid imperial title he had acquired. Part of the regional rulers refused to
acknowledge him, others observed external obedience but engaged in a network of
conspiracies. The population of the towns handed over to the Khitan rose in
revolt, but were savagely put down. However, this rising predetermined the
threatening disturbances. In 937 South-eastern China seceded and its ruler took
the title of Emperor of the Southern Tang. The Chinese then used this famous
name as their banner.</p>
<p>Complete disorder reigned in the Later Jin Empire and this
was useful only to the Khitan who, in 937, occupied Liaodong and ten years later
gave their empire the Chinese name of (Iron) Liao.  <a name="sik2text41"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note41">[+41]</a></p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{69} </font></b>This was in truth an iron empire, so
merciless to conquered peoples that nomads and Chinese combined to struggle
against the oppressors. In 941 several border tribes  <a name="sik2text42"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note42">[+42]</a>
proposed to Shi Jintang to post 100,000 troops to attack the Khitan, but were
refused. This demoralised the rebels; some tribes fled, and the rest were
defeated in 942. However, the wave of dissatisfaction continued to swell and
after Shi Jintang's death, despite his testament, his son was kept from the
throne which was occupied by his nephew Shi Zhonggui  <a name="sik2text43"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note43">[+43]</a>
who immediately tried to liberate his country. He arrested a Khitan official and
Khitan merchants and confiscated their goods. This meant war.</p>
<p>The first Khitan offensive in 944 was rebuffed, but in 946
Deguang, making use of the venality of the Chinese commanders, took the capital
of China, Kaifeng, and seized the emperor. Without thinking long, he took the
throne, and all the governors but two submitted to him. Returning home in 947,
he took with him an enormous number of Chinese prisoners who later settled in
Manchuria and intermingled with the Khitan. Chavannes and Wittfogel assert that
&quot;this monarch founded the truly Chinese dynasty of Liao&quot;.
 <a name="sik2text44"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note44">[+44]</a> On the way home he died.</p>
<p>From this time the dynasty became as it were Chinese. Deguang
changed his costume for Chinese dress robes and surrounded himself with Chinese
officials;  <a name="sik2text45"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note45">[+45]</a> he established customs in his
country closer to early feudalism than to the old tribal system
 <a name="sik2text46"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note46">[+46]</a> and, even before the victory, in 944 he refused a dynastic alliance
with the Uighur Arslan-khan. How different is this from the time when the
founder of the empire, Ambagan, declared his goodwill towards Buddhism in 916
and justified this to his fellow tribesmen as follows: &quot;Buddhism is not a
Chinese religion&quot;.  <a name="sik2text47"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note47">[+47]</a> Thirty years had passed
and Khitan had left the nomad world, more than that, it had become hostile to
it.</p>
<p>Did this not suit the Liao Empire, not to mention the Khitan
people? As soon as the corpse of the conqueror had been taken to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{70}
</font></b>Manchuria, China rose. On this occasion the Shato and Chinese united
and the regent of Hedong, Li Zhiyuan, with the active help of the population,
slaughtered the Khitan officials posted to Chinese towns, drove out the
foreigners and founded a new dynasty, the Later Han. But the alliance of Turks
and Chinese turned out to be unstable. In 951 a Chinese, Guo Wei, overthrew the
son of the liberator, who had begun to execute his father's generals, and
founded a purely Chinese empire, the Later Zhou, which was very hostile to
everything foreign. The remnants of the Shato attempted to organise resistance
in Shaanxi where they created the Northern Han kingdom which, thanks to an
alliance with the Khitan, survived until 969; but this epic, like the wars
between the Liao and the Song Empire, which replaced the Zhou in 960, are part
of Chinese history, while we are concerned with the steppe world independent of
Chinese influence.</p>
<p>Let us note certain features which are important to us.
First, the transposition of forces. In the early tenth century the Chinese were
opposed to the Tang traditions which defended the Turkic Shato. Then they were
victorious, but a quarter of a century later Chinese came to power who were the
ideological descendants of Huang Chao and the Shato returned to their old lands.
The vector of history had shifted through 180╟.</p>
<p>Second, the sharp decline in Shato strength and even their
degeneration over two generations. As long as they were a Turkic tribe with the
fighting skills of the steppe dwellers they were victorious. Mixing with the
Chinese they did not fuse with them. The Shato emperors were obliged to
supplement their troops and administration with representatives of the local
people and as a result a conglomerate was formed where a few Turks ruled and a
mixed stratum administered the Chinese population. Tribal traditions, of course,
disappeared and the nationality, dispersed, was converted into a pro-nomad
party, unpopular, of course, among the mass of the people and no longer a
fighting force.</p>
<p>Third, and most important, the Chinese reaction to foreign
domination. Let us adduce a few characteristic facts. Guo Wei, despite his
stormy period, patronised the study of classical literature although himself
illiterate. But he also desecrated and plundered eighteen tombs of the Tang
emperors.  <a name="sik2text48"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note48">[+48]</a> The direction of policy is <b><font COLOR="#943634">{71}
</font></b>clear. Chai Rong, Guo Wei's ancestor, closed 30,000 Buddhist
monasteries, leaving only 2,694 for very old monks and nuns,
 <a name="sik2text49"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note49">[+49]</a> and melted the bronze images of the Buddha down into coin. <a name="sik2text50"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note50">[+50]</a> A typical secularisation achieved by the founder of &quot;Chinese
humanism&quot;, Han Yu!  <a name="sik2text51"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note51">[+51]</a> Then, under the Song
dynasty these traditions were strengthened and excluded from China the whole
peaceful culture accepted under the Tang dynasty.  <a name="sik2text52"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note52">[+52]</a>
Then, at the end of the tenth century the Buddhists found refuge in the oases of
the Nanshan foothills and on the shores of Liao He, and the Nestorians in the
Great Steppe. The hearts of those driven out were hardened. Instead of subjects
who were freethinking dreamers, China now had tireless and implacable foes. Such
was history's price for achieving like-mindedness.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Food and Spice</h4>
<p>Our brief exposition of events has had only one aim: to
follow the mechanism of the split between the Chinese, Khitan and Turkic Shato.
Now we can return to the main thread of our investigation and see how this
episode appears in the presentation of a twentieth-century Chinese historian.
The victory of the Khitan, of course, is ascribed to the treachery of the
commander, unfortunately not a Turkic Shato, but a Chinese, who
&quot;shamelessly deceived the soldiers and compelled them to be disarmed. The
doleful cries of the soldiers shook the whole valley&quot;.
 <a name="sik2text53"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note53">[+53]</a> Well, but what sort of an army is this which allegedly wants to
fight, but then, in tears, surrenders to an enemy small in numbers?</p>
<p>Well, all right, but it gets stronger. &quot;The mighty
movement of popular forces [who killed isolated officials - L.G.] gave rise to
terror and confusion in the heart of Ye-lu Deguang who, turning to his suite,
said: 'I did not know it would be so difficult to subordinate the people of
China!' In a panic, he fled to the North taking with him a great number of the
population and much property...&quot; We must begin with the fact that the
chronology of events is confused. At first <b><font COLOR="#943634">{72} </font></b>Deguang
set off for home and died on the way, then the rising flared up when few Khitan
troops remained.  <a name="sik2text54"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note54">[+54]</a> Next, what sort of a panic is
it when the conqueror is returning with huge booty? And he went to war solely
for this. Finally, why did he &quot;flee&quot; when he left a regent in Kaifeng?
It was this regent that Li Zhiyuan, a Shato, the true saviour of the Chinese
people, drove out. But the only mention of him is that &quot;at this time the
former jiedushi (military governor) of Hedong proclaimed himself emperor in
Taiyuan&quot;. The Chinese rewarded their defender, you see! Guo Wei, a soldier
who had become a general betrayed and killed Li Zhiyuan's son, but it is said
that &quot;he was well acquainted with the people's sufferings&quot;, followed
by a panegyric to his virtues. That he pushed the Turkic Shato into the embraces
of the Khitan, thanks to which China was obliged to wage war for thirty years,
merely to return Shaanxi, of this the reader may guess, although the author has
done everything to confuse the matter. But the whole text is built up on
quotations from the sources. So what? Not bad, is it?</p>
<p>And then there is another extreme: the arid extraction of
information from the same sources. Such are the books by H. Cordier and R.
Grousset. They are useful as reference works, but the need for reference
absolutely demands an interest in the subject, and this is lost in a
kaleidoscope of names, dates and facts. It is as difficult to read these books
as the technical handbook by Hutte, and there is no need. No aesthetic delight
results, the memory is fruitlessly exhausted and rejects information not related
to any central core. But the latter has only to appear and the information falls
into beautiful ranks.</p>
<p>By the core I understand a perspective. One may regard the
history of the heroic Shato tribe from various points of view. The history of
their victories and destruction is a problem of the failure of various cultures
to fuse from the humanitarian perspective; a problem of an obligatory change of
landscape by ail ethnos and an impossibility of secondary adaptation from the
perspective of historical geography; a problem of inter-breeding with
incongruous psychological attitudes from the biological perspective; and,
finally, a problem of regression from the perspective of the philosophy of
history. In any event, it results in an interface between sciences. But there is
also a purely historical perspective - the logic of the events <b><font COLOR="#943634">{73}
</font></b>themselves - for example, an enemy invasion evokes resistance or
flight; a threat to the life of a regent, a rising or betrayal; the plundering
of a people, the poverty of the state; the protection of others, the
dissatisfaction of one's own people, and so on. The ninth- to tenth-century
events we are investigating here were a consequence of that variety of causal
link which, at the beginning of the nineteenth century, Pushkin called &quot;the
force of circumstances&quot;, and which now Porshnev proposes to call a
&quot;chain reaction&quot;. This is a second order regularity. Imposed on the
first order regularity - the development of productive forces and relations of
production - and summarising, these patterns form that groundwork of events
which is the starting point for historical analysis. The surface of an event
displays merely the consequences of deeply hidden causes. Wars and treaties,
laws and reforms arranged in synchronic tables permit the historian, by complex
analysis, first to elucidate the motives for events, and then to synthesise the
course of the process; and this is the crown of historical investigation.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>An Attempt at Spatial Analysis</h4>
<p>The brief information adduced about the Shato and Khitan may
seem excessive, because specialists in Far Eastern history possess, and can even
simply recall, much more information; but, then, other specialists, historians
of the Near East, archaeologists, Turcologists, and even historians of Central
Asia, are as a rule educated readers, and no more, of the history of the Far
East, and the other way round, too. In making sense of the history of Asia and
Europe as a unity it is more useful to select and adduce the necessary data,
rather than send the reader to rare, heavy works which he will not always be
able to find and read. Equally, one should not make him undertake the selection
from kaleidoscopic events; professional skills are needed for this, and they
vary with different specialists. Therefore, although a brief sketch of the
formation of the Khitan Empire is, of itself, not research, in the general plan
of our theme this is one of the cornerstones of the building we are
constructing.</p>
<p>The second essential support is the western frontier of the
nomad world. Here our task is simpler, for the reader will encounter names
known, accustomed places and events of which he could not have failed to hear
from childhood. We only have to recall them and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{74} </font></b>arrange
them in the order needed to restrict the historical &quot;gap&quot; to a
minimum. For a start, let us recall that the chief enemy of the nomads was the
so-called &quot;world of Islam&quot;, their involuntary ally was Byzantium, and
the object of their incursions was Latin-German Western Europe, and that heathen
Russia occupied a special place. Let us try to make sense of this kaleidoscope
by applying the panoramic method.</p>
<p>While Huang Chao was shaking the foundations of the Tang
dynasty, and the Dansyan, Shato and Khitan were still timidly sheltering along
the borders of the once terrible empire, the might of the &quot;Abbasid
caliphate collapsed. Turkish guards in Baghdad changed the caliphs at their
will, the leader of a brigand band, Yakub ibn Saffar, seized the eastern regions
of Iran and dictated conditions to the vice-regent of the Prophet; in lower
Mesopotamia slaves (zindji) brought from the bazaars of Zanzibar rebelled, and
the Greeks went over from defence to the offensive and took Asia Minor from the
Muslims. At the same time the Karluk moved south from the region of the Seven
Streams and took Kashgar in 861. In the West the empire of Charlemagne
collapsed, at first into three kingdoms: France, Lotharingia and Germany, and
then into ten, and it continued to fragment. Papal authority increased against
this background and opposed itself to the Byzantine emperor; Pope Nicholas I
excommunicated Patriarch Photius from the church and thus initiated the Schism
between the West and the Christian East.</p>
<p>Twenty years passed. The Tang Empire fell, the eight Khitan
tribes united. At this time in the Near East the zindji had been defeated, but
the Bedouin of Bahrein had advanced against the caliphate - the Qarmatians who
took control of the whole of Arabia and Syria. In Central Asia in place of the
Saffarid brigands the mighty power of Ismail Samani was created, loyal to the
caliph, but essentially independent. It was able to halt the onslaught of the
&quot;faithless Turks&quot; on Central Asia, though the Europeans were unable to
do this. The Magyars penetrated into Pannonia (895) and soon converted it into
Hungary. The Pechenegs, after losing the war with the Guz, made their way into
the Black Sea steppes (889) and reached the mouth of the Danube (900). Byzantium
heroically repelled the onslaught of the Bolgars, and Western Europe became the
object of attacks by Normans and Hungarians, the latter twice reaching Spain.
Then the undistinguished Carolingians were deprived of power and feudal lords
took over the matter of defence <b><font COLOR="#943634">{75} </font></b>with
Eudes, Count of Pans, showing an example and defending the town from the Normans
(886)</p>
<p>In the years when the Khitan Deguang was creating the Liao
empire and set his minion on the throne of China (936), at the western edge of
the steppe, around the Black Sea, a brutal war developed between the declining
califate and a Byzantium growing in strength The Greeks made systematic advances
on the Arabs and took from them Samosata, Malatia and Western Armenia But the
Muslim were able to give blow for blow they acquired new allies The Volga
Bolgars converted to Islam (922) and the Jewish government of Khazaria, linked
to the Hither East by trade, supplied the Muslim with a flow of income in the
form of valuable furs from the forests of Biarmia, or Great Perm About 932
Khazaria entered the war and compelled the Alans to renounce Orthodoxy The
Byzantine emperor Romanus Lecapenus in response began to persecute the Jews in
Byzantium and they left in masses for Khazana Rus', where Igor was ruling from
912, took Byzantium's side, but in 915 the Khazars had set the Pechenegs on Rus'
and about 940 the Rus' military leader, Khel'gu, attempting to seize the
fortress of Samkerts (Taman'), was obliged to capitulate to the superior forces
of the Khazar ruler, Pesakh. The Russians were released on condition of
concluding a military alliance against the Greeks,  <a name="sik2text55"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note55">[+55]</a>
and the Khazars compelled the Pechenegs to do the same. Yet in 941 Igor's attack
on Constantinople ended in complete defeat, and a second misfired, despite
Pecheneg help.</p>
<p>We have to think that in Rus' at that time there was no
single foreign policy, since simultaneously with Igor's attacks some Rus' force
passed through Khazaria along the Volga and plundered the town of Berdaa in
Azerbaijan. This campaign also brought the Rus' neither wealth, nor fame
Epidemics claimed many victims, and those who survived were driven out by the
Muslim forces. The Rus', however, could only pass to the Caspian with Khazar
permission. Therefore, one should recognise that in the 940s the leadership in
Eastern Europe belonged to the government of Khazana.</p>
<p>The interpretation we have proposed does not agree with the
generally accepted one put forward by S.M. Solov'ev which is based on the
chronicler's silence about clashes between the Khazar kaganate and Oleg's Rus'
principality. The sensitive historian paid <b><font COLOR="#943634">{76} </font></b>special
attention to this gap in the chain of events, but, lacking adequate facts, he
supposed that the Pecheneg threat tied down the Khazar forces.
 <a name="sik2text56"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note56">[+56]</a> Now, in the light of M.I. Artamonov's general survey, it has become
clear that the Rus' lost the first war with the Khazars.
 <a name="sik2text57"></a><a href="sik2a.htm#sik2note57">[+57]</a> That was why the members of Igor's retinue began to complain to the
prince of their poverty and compelled him to undertake the suicidal campaign
against the Drevlyane in 946.</p>
<p>The difficult situation of the young principality of Kiev
only improved in 957, when Ol'ga restored the alliance with Byzantium, accepting
baptism and becoming the god-daughter of the Emperor Constantine Porphyrogenitus
himself. After this, Rus' detachments appeared in the Byzantine army, fighting
in Crete and Syria in 960-62, and Rus' itself gathered its forces for a struggle
with the Khazar kaganate. But fortune smiled on the Rus' warriors only in the
960s; before this there had been a difficult period about which the chronicler
preferred to speak evasively.</p>
<p>The disposition of forces changed throughout the whole world.
The increase in the strength of Western Europe began. The German king, Otto I,
defeated the Hungarians on the Lechfeld (955) after which the advance of the
Europeans on the rest of the world began.</p>
<p>And the nomads? As before, they sought the borders of the
steppes, whatever it might cost them, for the steppe was drying up. Not having
the strength to break the defensive lines built by the Samanids in Central Asia,
they began to accept Islam in order to be allowed into regions where there was
still some water. At first these were the Turkmen-Seljuks, then the Karluk (960)
and, finally, the Yagma tribe (about 1000). In just the same way the Pechenegs
strove for the great rivers Dnepr and Danube, because the great, silent desert
was extending at their backs, swallowing up the steppe grass and filling the
streams with sand.</p>
<p>That is why the tenth-century chroniclers are silent about
events in the centre of the continent. For a long time no events took place <b><font COLOR="#943634">{77}
</font></b>there, and when they began again, they immediately appeared in the
chronicles and geographical treatises. But this is a new period which will be
dealt with later.</p>

<p><a name="sik2note57"></A><A HREF="sik2a.htm#sik2text57">[+57]</a> M.I. Artamonov <i>(Istoriya khazar) </i>himself
does not draw this conclusion (see pp. 382-3), but comparison of his own data
with the general situation in the mid-tenth century shows that Joseph, king of
Khazana, was right when he wrote that only his stubborn and successful war with
Rus' had saved all the Muslim lands as far as Baghdad from being plundered (P.K.
Kokovtsov, <i>Evreisko-khazarskaya perepiska v X v</i>, 83-4, 102), and this is
confirmed by the existence of an alliance with the Muslim rulers in the Near
East.</p>
