<h4>Why Is This Important?</h4>
<p>We have just established three important and regrettable
propositions: (1) Chinggiskhan's victory over his competitors in the territory
of the Great Steppe is inexplicable if we take account solely of the undoubted
facts, and worse than that, given the particular arrangement of forces could not
have been realised. Yet it did take place, so we have missed something; (2) both
historical versions, the secret and the official, give distorted accounts of the
course of events, are full of silences and contradictions, extremely tendentious
and do not complement one another; (3) Mongol society was not primitive and
amorphous, but the contradictions between it and the Nestorian khanates were
mitigated only by political necessity. The demand for compromise with subjugated
neighbours arose only after the Steppe, where Nestorians formed the majority of
the population, had been united. But until 1206 the Mongols and Christians had
fought one another, and the balance of numbers had been on the side of the
latter. So why and how did they lose?</p>
<p>Here we have to turn to a most painstaking analysis, to an
investigation of the psychology of the main participants in the early
thirteenth-century tragedy. Special approaches are needed here and the methods
of Sherlock Holmes, Father Brown and even Agatha Christie. Here we shall pose
the problems: how did a particular crime take place, who committed it and who
benefited from it? In other words, we shall try to squeeze out a grain of truth
from the false sources. It is also good that we have a key in our hands to all
locks to all doors. This is one of the participants in the events, the Jajirat
prince Jamuqa-sechen, Chinggiskhan's best friend and main enemy. The turning
point, after which historical Mongolia arose like a phoenix from the ashes, is
reflected in their mutual relationship as in the heart of a crystal.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{245} </font></b>Two ways are possible to
investigate this question a completely trite one, and a not very trite one. The
first would consist of the author writing out all mentions of Jamuqa in the
sources, putting the notes in chronological order and drawing the conclusion
that the problem is complex and for the time being insoluble. This way would be
a very good one for a thesis. The second way is to follow the facts of (not the
questions about) Jamuqa's life and attempt to sort out the motives for his
conduct. This way we can exclude the bias of the two basic sources, the
Collection of Chronicles and the Secret History, of which the first treats the
whole canvas of events as Chinggiskhan's struggle with his enemies, and the
second as his relations with his friends Accordingly, with Rashid ad-Din Jamuqa
is merely an unprincipled adventurer, and it is incomprehensible how he had such
popularity that 75% of Mongols supported him against Chinggiskhan, while in the
Secret History the author in general cannot and does not want to tie up the
ends. This is where the weak spot is found which affords the chance for
historical criticism to be brought into play It is on this we shall concentrate
our attention.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>At the Site of Bayidaraq-Belchir</h4>
<p>Above we noted Jamuqa's inexplicable conduct in the first
clashes with Chinggiskhan his departure after the victory at Dalan-baljut and
the plundering of the people who had chosen Jamuqa as a khan after the defeat of
the anti-Chinggis coalition at Koyiten. Now let us turn our attention to the
part Jamuqa played in the Mongol-Naiman war of 1202. Let us recall that after
the first success of the Mongol and Kerait raid on the Naiman Buyiruq-qan, the
allies were caught by the main Naiman army of Kokse'u-sabraq Ong-qan left
Temujin in danger, but was defeated by the Naiman who pursued him and was
rescued from his trouble by Temujin's magnanimity for which he adopted him as a
son Moreover, Jamuqa, his recent enemy, is for some reason at the Kerait
headquarters and gives Ong-qan advice which he accepts despite the opposition of
his grandees, for example, Gunn-ba'atur who accuses Jamuqa of insincerity. As a
result, instead of the friendship between the related and allied tribes of
Mongols and Kerait being strengthened, war for some reason suddenly broke out
and ended in the complete defeat of the Kerait, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{246}
</font></b>despite the fact that they had preponderant numbers
and the initiative.</p>
<p>The account of these events in Rashid ad-Din and the author
of the Secret History diverges quite sharply in places,  <a name="sik4text32"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note32">[+32]</a> but as regards what
took place at the site of Bayidaraq-belchir it coincides down to the details.
Not only the sequence of events, but even the participants` words are given
similarly. This cannot be a chance coincidence, so it puts us on our guard.
After all, the aims and attitudes of both authors were opposed, as we have seen
above, but here both authors found something important for each of them. If we
take into account that a feature of the author of the Secret History is his
desire to engage in psychological explanation, while Rashid ad-Din has a
tendency to superficial explanation - but it is explanation - then it becomes
clear: first, that this story has a double meaning, an internal and a
superficial one; and, second, that we can even penetrate to the deep meaning,
for there would have been no need for the author of the Secret History to insert
this story had its deep meaning not become clear, though not at once, but in the
course of the further narration.</p>
<p>As for Rashid ad-Din, he inserted this history only to
strengthen his assertion of Jamuqa's inclination &quot;to hypocrisy and
ill-intentions&quot;. This becomes particularly clear when he conveys the words
of Gurin-ba'atur, Ong-qan's senior noyan. Rashid ad-Din specially concentrates
attention on Gurin-ba'atur, because for him he is the main person of the event
described: Ong-qan's noyan accuses Jamuqa of slander and hypocrisy. Rashid
ad-Din is much less interested in all the rest. That is why we have almost
identical texts.</p>
<p>We learn that Chinggis and Ong-qan had a battle with the
Naiman, that it was not completed and the opponents spent the night opposite one
another intending to take up arms again the next <b><font COLOR="#943634">{247}
</font></b>day. We further learn that suddenly during the night
Ong-qan and all the Kerait left Chinggis for some reason. Then, Ong-qan caught
up with Jamuqa; a conversation took place between them. After this we are told
of Chinggis's reaction to Ong-qan's departure and the rout of the Kerait by the
Naiman.</p>
<p>All is by no means without cause. The chief point is why did
Ong-qan leave? Why did Ong-qan desert Chinggis, since he was linked with him by
bonds of friendship? It is clear that a quarrel took place that evening between
Ong-qan and Chinggis. It was because of this that Ong-qan left, but he did not
consider this a final break (Gurin-ba'atur regarded this quarrel the same way).
Ong-qan, after being routed by the Naiman who had pursued him, turned to
Chinggis for help, the man whom, at first glance, he had so suddenly and
treacherously left (unless we paid attention to the exceeding suddenness of what
happened). Had this been treachery, cowardice, would he have been able to count
on Chinggis's help? And would the latter have helped him? But Chinggis sent a
force to help Ong-qan. That means he had a right to ask. It means he had the
last word in the evening's quarrel. He then said &quot;No&quot; and left. His
request for help was his &quot;Yes&quot;!</p>
<p>In fact, let us turn our attention to what followed all these
events. The Secret History says about this: &quot;... Ong-qan said: 'So, once my
<i>anda, </i>Yisugei-ba'atur, saved my lost ulus for me, a second time my son
Temujin saved my ruined ulus for me ... It is just as if I have no sons, only
Senggum alone. I would make my son Temujin Senggum's elder brother!'&quot;  <a name="sik4text33"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note33">[+33]</a>
The significance of this step by Ong-qan is not open to doubt. The affirmation
of Chinggis as Senggum's elder brother is an affirmation of the Kerait
inheritance. That was the subject of the quarrel, that was why Ong-qan at first
said &quot;no&quot;; that is the true cause of his leaving. His &quot;yes&quot;
was compelled by pressure of circumstances, it was payment for help. His request
for help was also his &quot;yes&quot;. That is why he called Chinggis in his
moment of difficulty and why Chinggis willingly responded and achieved what he
aspired to. And then: &quot;After these speeches Ong-qan went with Chinggiskhan
to the Black Forest on the Tu`ula and they took their vows to one another as
father and son.&quot;  <a name="sik4text34"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note34">[+34]</a> Ong-qan did not do this at all joyfully (but one's
word is one's word), and it is not for nothing that we afterwards find in Rashid
ad-Din a story that <b><font COLOR="#943634">{248} </font></b>Ong-qan
subsequently even prepared an attempt on Chinggis's life.  <a name="sik4text35"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note35">[+35]</a> The Secret History
continues: &quot;Chinggiskhan, though, thought to strengthen their mutual
good-will. For this he decided to ask the hand of Senggum's younger sister for
Jochi ... &quot;  <a name="sik4text36"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note36">[+36]</a> Chinggiskhan receives a polite refusal, and &quot;during
these negotiations Chinggiskhan privately cooled both towards Ong-qan and
towards Nilqa-Senggum.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Nevertheless, I Do Not Believe the Texts, and This Is Why</h4>
<p>It seems everything is clear, but what was Jamuqa's part in
this story? It is incomprehensible, just as puzzling as his appearance in
Ong-qan's and Chinggis's headquarters when he had just been fighting them, and
as his disappearance from the narrative after the scene which took place during
Ong-qan's departure. This puzzle is concealed in the words which Jamuqa said to
Ong-qan, in Ong-qan's silence and in Gurin-ba'atur's reply. Gurin-ba'atur's
reply throws light on one circumstance which assisted neither the author of the
Secret History nor Rashid ad-Din to learn the true cause of Ong-qan's departure.
The point was that only three people knew what had happened: Ong-qan, Chinggis
and Jamuqa. All the other witnesses of the event knew far from everything and
saw what took place distortedly. In fact, Gurin-ba'atur, a honest, sincere, but
not too bright warrior, said (according to Rashid ad-Din): &quot;It ill befits
to make such hypocritical speeches between friends and relatives&quot;,  <a name="sik4text37"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note37">[+37]</a> or
(according to the Secret History): &quot;Why out of servility do you so
dishonour and revile your honest brothers?&quot;  <a name="sik4text38"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note38">[+38]</a> Accepting Jamuqa's words
literally, satisfied with the surface meaning, Gurin-ba'atur shows, in rebutting
Jamuqa, that he had no cause to seek a deep meaning. It seems to him that Jamuqa
is slandering Chinggis. And, not doubting Ong-qan's attitude to his words,
despite the fact that Ong-qan is for some reason silent, he sharply cuts Jamuqa
short. It is clear that he does not know what took place, and if he perceives
what is taking place as dissension, it is as a temporary one. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{249}
</font></b>Therefore, in his conception Jamuqa's words are base;
Jamuqa in his opinion is simply trying to use the opportunity to sow the seeds
of hatred, and so his attempts have to be stopped. That is Gurin-ba'atur's logic
and that of any Kerait observing the leaders&quot; conversation from the
sidelines.</p>
<p>We do not know, and have no right to suppose, how Ong-qan's
departure was arranged. Did he leave alone, or did Chinggis move off at the same
time; we do not know how they agreed or how far they observed the conditions.
But suddenly it was Chinggis who violated the agreement and lingered in order to
create the impression that Ong-qan had betrayed him?! Considerations of prestige
are always of great significance. We do not know any of this, but we do know
enough to understand the conduct of the three heroes of the tale. It was
determined by two factors: a disagreement, and that none of the Mongols and
Kerait knew of its true causes or even of the disagreement itself.</p>
<p>Why does Ong-qan himself keep silent in these very important
negotiations? Why does he not object and not agree, so that his military
commander answers for him? Is it not because he heard in Jamuqa's flattering and
false words something more than the simple-hearted Gurin-ba'atur? And is that
not why he is silent, overwhelmed by what he has heard?</p>
<p>What was it that Jamuqa uttered? According to Rashid ad-Din:
&quot;O khan of khans, you, of course, know my senior and junior relatives are
like sparrows that make their way from the summer grazing grounds to the winter
pastures; in other words, Chinggiskhan, my relative, intends to fly. I have
always said that I am your sparrow.&quot;  <a name="sik4text39"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note39">[+39]</a> In this version Jamuqa tries to
present his sworn brother as a cunning and perfidious man.</p>
<p>According to the Secret History: &quot;It is a well-known
matter that my <i>anda </i>Temujin has long exchanged emissaries with the Naiman.
That is why he has not moved up with us now (!) Khan, khan! I, now, am a
permanently present gull, but my <i>anda </i>is a migratory bird, a lark&quot;.
 <a name="sik4text40"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note40">[+40]</a> The sense seems to be the same, but the image is different. The author of
the Secret History, sympathising with Jamuqa, gave his words quite a different
tone. That it was he who distorted the source and not Rashid ad-Din is seen from
the sharp tone of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{250} </font></b>Gurin-ba'atur's
reply which is more apt with Rashid ad-Din's version where the sense of the
phrase conceals an allegory of flight. The specific expression &quot;my senior
and junior relatives&quot; refers both to Ong-qan and to Chinggis who was one
and a half years younger than Jamuqa. The load of this part of the phrase is
light and it only puts us on our guard, prepares the question - what did Jamuqa
want to say by this? But all the same it awakens our first suspicions:
associations with the words &quot;flight&quot; and &quot;relatives&quot;.
Ong-qan might think, for example, that Jamuqa is talking of him and there and
then mentally ask: &quot;So what?'</p>
<p>The second part of the phrase bears the main load: &quot;In
other words, Chinggiskhan, my relative, intends to fly.&quot; In the Secret
History Jamuqa indicates where - &quot;to the Naiman&quot; - and explains:
&quot;That is why he has not moved up with us now ... It is clear that he has
deserted to the Naiman. That is why he is late!&quot;</p>
<p>We do not know all the upheavals of this terrible night. The
only thing clear is that all that occurred was much more complex than the scheme
which the sources give. Perhaps there was only a quarrel between Ong-qan and
Chinggis and there was no agreement to part. Perhaps Ong-qan decided in fact to
leave Chinggis secretly. Perhaps it was not a quarrel, but Chinggis's delay
which made him leave. These are all hypotheses which give no answer to the
problem. But we can indicate the line along which events developed: Ong-qan's
leaving the battlefield set the question of where to go before both Chinggis and
Ong-qan himself. It is difficult to say what Ong-qan had in view, but it is
clear that Chinggis least of all wanted his ally to find a common language with
the Naiman. Consequently, he should set himself the aim of preventing such a
combination, whether it entered into Ong-qan's plans or not. Here Jamuqa again
appears. The very fact that after the battles at Dalan-baljut and Koyiten Jamuqa
turned up in the same camp as Chinggis is surprising. We cannot yet explain it.
But Jamuqa's new position is an unarguable fact, despite the fact that it by no
means embellishes the Jajirat prince.</p>
<p>Gurin-ba'atur speaks with him as an equal and does not
hesitate to display the disdain which shows through his speech and which Jamuqa
somehow deserved. The supposition of a new stage in the relations between Jamuqa
and Chinggis alone can throw light on a number of obscure corners in the Secret
History. Jamuqa continually finds himself among Chinggis's enemies, but plays a
double <b><font COLOR="#943634">{251} </font></b>game
there. Here he plays Chinggis's hand, frightening Ong-qan from reconciliation
with the Naiman. To do this it was enough to say that Chinggis himself had
already come to an agreement with the enemy; this single phrase was enough for
the terrified Ong-qan to turn to flight.</p>
<p>But why did Ong-qan believe Jamuqa and not take this talk as
slander, like Gurin-ba'atur? Because he knew of his own quarrel with Chinggis
which his associates did not, but which Jamuqa evidently did. Therefore, the
latter's news was able to seem truthful to the Kerait khan. And how was he not
to fear Chinggis's perfidy when he was trying to become his heir? But then how
was Jamuqa so well informed? If not from Ong-qan, which is excluded, then only
from Chinggis. It means that the enmity of these two outstanding Mongols was
only a screen concealing ... but let us refrain from conclusions and analyse the
further events.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Among the Kerait and Naiman</h4>
<p>There never have been and cannot be collisions in which all
gain. In our case, Ong-qan's legitimate heir, Nilqa, a quite brave and decisive
man turned out to have lost. He had been used to the thought that the throne of
the Kerait khanate would be granted him, but he was pushed aside, though
politely, yet irrevocably. Therefore, he naturally found himself in the camp of
those dissatisfied with his not too popular father and his over-insistent friend
and, being a sincere man, expressed his point of view directly, declaring with
regard to Jochi's match with his sister: &quot;Well, perhaps our kinsfolk have
to sit at your door and only by chance glance at the seat of honour. But your
kinsfolk should sit at our seat of honour and look towards the door.&quot;  <a name="sik4text41"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note41">[+41]</a></p>
<p>As soon as this became known a deputation came to Senggum
consisting of Jamuqa, evidently having completely made his peace with the Kerait,
Altan and Quchar, Mongol aristocrats who in their day had raised Temujin to
Chinggiskhan, the Kara-Khitan Ebugejin-Noyakin and two heroes: To'oril of the
Soge'en tribe  <a name="sik4text42"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note42">[+42]</a> <b><font COLOR="#943634">{252} </font></b>and
Qachi'un-beki.  <a name="sik4text43"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note43">[+43]</a> They proposed to help the disgraced prince to regain his
right to the throne after dealing with Chinggiskhan, but they did not advise him
to go against his father at all. In fact, the khan was persuaded and gave his
agreement to lure Chinggis under pretence of matchmaking and kill him. Fidelity
to his friends and to his word was not a distinguishing feature of the Kerait
ruler.</p>
<p>The composition of the deputation tells us a lot. First, its
social appearance: the entire Mongol clan nobility which had, it seems, by now
left Chinggiskhan. And it is important that the conspiracy only failed because
two simple horseherds, Badai and Kishliq, betrayed their noble lord and informed
Chinggiskhan of the intended attempt on his life. Here we have before us a
moment of social disagreement; potential &quot;people of long will&quot; stand
forth against the clan nobility which is trying to base itself on a neighbouring
power. Second, the presence of representatives from the Kara-Khitan khanate
shows the continuing efforts of the Uighur-Nestorians to achieve the unification
of the steppe. There is no direct indication of the part played by Uighur
merchants in organising the anti-Chinggis coalition, but the disposition of
forces in 1203 suggests this. Muhammed, enemy of the infidel, was on the throne
in Khwarizm.  <a name="sik4text44"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note44">[+44]</a> It is true that in 1204 he had to ask for Kara-Khitan help
against the Gurids, but before this his relations with the gurkhan had been
strained and this had reflected on the trade between the Far and Near East.
Muslim merchants tried to seize the profitable trade with Siberia, and while the
Kara-Khitan emissary was raising the Kerait against Chinggis the Muslim merchant
Asan was buying up squirrel and sable pelts from the Mongols.  <a name="sik4text45"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note45">[+45]</a></p>
<p>In itself the existence of trade tells us nothing, but the
fact that the author of the Secret History recalled it in describing the most
dramatic moment in Chinggiskhan's war with the Kerait shows its importance for
the thirteenth-century reader. The author, after all, is no partisan of
Christianity and seizes the chance to stress that at the critical moment it was
Muslims, not Nestorians, who were Chinggiskhan's friends.</p>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{253} </font></b>But Jamuqa's position is the
most interesting thing for us. He starts with a slander against Chinggis who had
allegedly reached an agreement with the Naiman Tayang-qan. It seems no one
believes this, because the causes for hating Chinggis lie on another plane. But
slander is not neglected in morally preparing public opinion, even if it does no
real harm to one's opponent because of its complete absurdity.</p>
<p>Subsequent events are still more interesting. Although
Chinggis, warned of treachery, managed to move off, the hostile coalition
overtook him. But the dust raised by his opponents&quot; advance guard again
told him of the Kerait attack and Chinggiskhan &quot;seized his gelding, loaded
up and rode off. A little longer and it would have been too late. It turns out,
Jamuqa approached ...&quot;  <a name="sik4text46"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note46">[+46]</a> What is this? Carelessness or treachery? Had
Jamuqa been a consistent enemy of Chinggis, as Rashid ad-Din depicts him,  <a name="sik4text47"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note47">[+47]</a> he
should have flung himself into the chase, but instead of this he halted to meet
the main forces and began to explain to Ong-qan how strong and careful the
Mongols were. Meanwhile, the Mongols had managed to make their preparations for
battle. Finally, when Ong-qan proposed that Jamuqa should lead the battle, he
refused and, moreover, gave Chinggiskhan the precise disposition of the Kerait
force,  <a name="sik4text48"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note48">[+48]</a> thanks to which certain victory was snatched from Ong-qan's hands.
After this the author of the Secret History as it were forgets about Jamuqa, but
Rashid ad-Din fills the gap, relating that Jamuqa again engaged in a conspiracy,
this time against Ong-qan. He urged several Mongol and Tatar leaders to organise
a third party hostile to both Chinggis and Ong-qan. The latter damaged and
plundered the grazing grounds of the conspirators, but by so doing deprived
himself of his allies, part of whom returned to Chinggis and part went over to
the Naiman.  <a name="sik4text49"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note49">[+49]</a> Among the latter was Jamuqa.</p>
<p>It may, and even should, seem strange that Jamuqa, constantly
accusing Chinggiskhan of links with the Naiman, himself appeared on their side;
but we have seen how much his actions failed to result in any benefit, so it is
time to stop simply being surprised. But before we seek the explanation of such
unusual behaviour by the wise <b><font COLOR="#943634">{254} </font></b>(sechen)
Jajirat prince, let us look at how he behaved in Tayang-qan's camp. It was just
the same as in Ong-qan's headquarters and before it. Jamuqa, commanding the
united forces of the Mongol tribes not conquered by Chinggis, was regarded by
the Naiman as a most valuable ally and Tayang-qan trusted him. Before the battle
Jamuqa tried to frighten his ally by describing the strength of the Mongols,
then led off his troops and sent news to Chinggiskhan that the Naiman khan was
demoralised and the offensive could be started. His advice was constructive, the
Naiman suffered complete defeat, and then all Jamuqa's Mongols surrendered to
Chinggiskhan.</p>
<p>Now we can pose the question: for whose benefit did Jamuqa
operate in consistently betraying Chinggiskhan's opponents, who trusted him? Or,
more precisely, who was the true beneficiary from Jamuqa's advice? Only one man
- Chinggiskhan! Furthermore, if there had been no Jamuqa, if no one had urged
Nilqa-Senggum into a reckless, untimely conflict, scared the gawping
Chinggiskhan, exposed the Naiman flank during the battle, then Chinggiskhan
would hardly have succeeded in overcoming the brave and warlike nomads,
including the Mongols themselves. And here only a single solution occurs: what
if the sworn brothers remained friends to the end? But let us see how
Chinggiskhan himself perceived the situation that had developed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>The Ruin of Jamuqa</h4>
<p>While up to now the differences between the two versions we
have investigated concerned details, in the last act of the tragedy of
Jamuqa-sechen they are extremely significant. The author of the Secret History
and Rashid ad-Din agree and differ on the following points.  <a name="sik4text50"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note50">[+50]</a></p>
<p>(a) after the defeat of the Naiman Jamuqa was deprived of the
support of the Mongol tribes and was left with a small detachment; but Rashid
ad-Din determined the size of this detachment as 60 men, while the Secret
History says 5 horsemen. In the second case this is a band;</p>
<p>(b) the soldiers seized Jamuqa and brought him before
Chinggis, but he punished them for betraying their &quot;natural lord&quot;. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{255}
</font></b>According to Rashid ad-Din, however, only thirty
warriors were executed and the rest were incorporated in the army;</p>
<p>(c) Jamuqa was executed: according to Rashid ad-Din by being
dismembered like the worst enemy; according to the Secret History he himself
asked to be killed &quot;without bloodshed&quot;, despite the fact that
Chinggiskhan offered him the second place in the kaganate and a renewal of
friendship.</p>
<p>Thus, not only the account of what happened, but also its
interpretation and the description of Chinggiskhan's chief rival are so varied
that we are entitled to pose the question: who are we to believe?</p>
<p>Most probably both versions are inexact, like any tendentious
source of information. However, the extent to which reality is distorted plays
an important part. It is not all the same whether we are close to or far from
the truth. So, let us formulate our task more clearly: which variant is
preferable for research and criticism? Let us sort out the differences point by
point:</p>
<p>(a) 60 horsemen at that time was a military formation. Such a
detachment could make a retreat. The Altai mountains, the Kipchak steppes, the
rich Seven Streams area were ready to accept heroes struggling against military
despotism. But five men were nothing. Any Mongol detachment could catch them,
while they themselves could not risk plundering anyone's grazing ground and
would have to feed themselves by hunting and hide from everyone, which is very
difficult. Based on these considerations it seems that the Secret History
version is more probable and the psychology of men so persecuted that their
nerves failed to hold out becomes understandable.</p>
<p>(b) The information that half the warriors who brought the
bound Jamuqa to Chinggiskhan were included in the army is expressed very
unclearly, and we can even imagine that those granted mercy had not taken part
in capturing their prince, but had merely been his relatives. Rashid ad-Din's
text is composed in a succinct and elliptical way and for this reason alone
inspires less confidence than the precise information of the Secret History.</p>
<p>(c) The question of the method of execution. Mongols killed
people readily, but simply. Either they broke the spine, or they tore out the
heart and sacrificed it to their banner. A long drawn out execution with torture
is not characteristic of the nomads, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{256}
</font></b>but of the Near Eastern Muslims. Therefore, again the
Secret History version deserves to be preferred, the more so since its author
was contemporary with the events and wrote his work for people who would have
rapidly realised any ethnographic absurdity, while the readers of the Collection
of Chronicles would have paid no attention to such details.</p>
<p>But the most important thing is that the interpretation of
Jamuqa's character and conduct proposed by Rashid ad-Din is not at all
convincing. On the one side, it is said that he was &quot;extremely intelligent
and cunning&quot;, and on the other, he is depicted as an unprincipled intriguer
who &quot;more than once fled from Chinggiskhan and went away to his enemies,
Ong-qan and Tayang-qan&quot;.  <a name="sik4text51"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note51">[+51]</a> But for some reason they accepted him,
although they, too, were not stupid. Evidently, they had some basis for that.</p>
<p>Rashid ad-Din, considering that simple ambition possessed
Jamuqa, does not even attempt to explain what his popularity rested on. Yet it
is not enough to be a bad man to carry peoples and rulers with you!</p>
<p>And it is not chance that such solid historians as V.V.
Bartol'd, B.Ya. Vladimirtsov, S.A. Kozin, interpreting the text critically,
proposed the reverse conception: Jamuqa is the leader of steppe democracy,
struggling against the aristocracy,  <a name="sik4text52"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note52">[+52]</a> or, on the contrary: an aristocrat, a
lord, warring with the people's leader,  <a name="sik4text53"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note53">[+53]</a> or a man having &quot;democratic
tendencies, but... who himself does not know what he wants and rushes from one
side to another&quot;.  <a name="sik4text54"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note54">[+54]</a> The last opinion is, perhaps, closest to the image
which the author of the Secret History so nicely depicted, but we cannot accept
even that since our observations urge us along a different road. Uncovering the
false should necessarily precede searching for the truth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Cause for Thought</h4>
<p>The author of the Secret History, a contemporary of and
participant in the events, describes the encounter of the sworn brothers who
were at odds with one another as follows: &quot;And Chinggiskhan said: <b><font COLOR="#943634">{257}
</font></b>&quot;This is what you are to say to Jamuqa: Here you
and I have come together. We shall be friends. Again becoming my second shaft,
you surely will not think differently from me again? Now uniting we shall call
to mind what we have forgotten, we shall rouse the sleeper. However much our
paths diverged, nevertheless you were always my fortunate and sacred friend. In
days of truly mortal battle you were concerned for me with both heart and soul.
However much we thought differently, yet in the days of fierce battles you
suffered for me with all your heart. I shall recall when this was. First, you
served me at the time of the battle with the Kerait at Qaraqaljit-elet, sending
to warn me of Ong-qan's dispositions; second, you served me, vividly telling me
how you frightened the Naiman, mortifying them with your word, killing them with
your mouth'&quot;  <a name="sik4text55"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note55">[+55]</a></p>
<p>However unexpectedly, Chinggiskhan thanks Jamuqa precisely
for his being in the enemy camp at critical moments; in other words, for spying
and diversionary activity carried out for Chinggiskhan's benefit. This does not
differ from our observations and is confirmed by them. And from this point of
view it is understandable why it was important for Chinggis that Jamuqa should
be at liberty and considered his worst enemy and thus gain the approval of
mighty khans opposed to Chinggis. If Chinggis had been able to release Jamuqa
without noise and publicity, of course, he would have done it, but the idiot
nokors spoilt the whole game because the whole steppe knew of the capture of the
Mongol khan's main opponent. No one had to be any the wiser, and Jamuqa was
executed and all those necessary were informed.</p>
<p>In order to formalise the death sentence legally for a
prisoner of war, he had to be found guilty and declared a war criminal. Mere
participation in war was in no case considered a sin; no one was tried for
boldness in battle. Then Chinggiskhan recalled the battle at Dalan-baljut and
ordered the prisoner to be told: &quot;You perfidiously and unjustly caused a
battle over the mutual stealing of herds between Jochi-Darmala and Taichar. You
attacked and we fought ... But now, they tell me, you do not want to accept
either the friendship offered you, nor mercy for your life. In that case you
will be allowed to die without bloodshed.&quot;  <a name="sik4text56"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note56">[+56]</a></p>
<p>In the Secret History version only one thing is doubtful:
that the initiative for execution came from Jamuqa himself. And it is all the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{258}
</font></b>stranger that in Rashid ad-Din there is the same
version, although in another aspect. Moreover, with the Persian compiler this
episode is so slurred over that its interpretation may be ignored; we only note
that in this case both tales derive from a single primary source, and let the
reader judge how far it can be trusted.</p>
<p>To start with Jamuqa talks exceedingly self-confidently:
&quot;Black crows have taken it into their head to seize the drake. Slaves have
taken it into their head to raise their hand against their khan. With the khan,
my <i>anda, </i>what do they give for this? The grey mousers have taken it into
their head to seize the curly-crested duck. The household slaves have taken it
into their .head to rise against their natural lord. With the khan, my <i>anda, </i>what
do they give for this?&quot;  <a name="sik4text57"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note57">[+57]</a> Evidently the captured prince was sure it would
turn out badly for those who had betrayed him . .. and he was right. But what
does this certainty rely on? Of course, exactly such betrayers of their natural
lord, Badai and Kishliq, who had warned Chinggiskhan of the Kerait raid,
received the highest mercy. And Jamuqa's nokors themselves, who could not but
know their people's customs, expected rewards, not execution, from the khan.
Otherwise they would not have entered the lion's den. So, Jamuqa knew something
they did not. This &quot;something&quot; was Chinggis's proposal that Jamuqa
become the second shaft of the cart of state for the services he had performed.
But then his tone changes (of course, in the source, how it was in reality we do
not know): &quot;Now, my khan, <i>anda, </i>you graciously offer me friendship.
But, you see, we did not become friends when it was the time to do so.&quot;</p>
<p>What sort of a declamation is this? If Jamuqa had been
recognised as Chinggis's friend, neither the Kerait, nor the Naiman would have
relied on his advice and would not have been betrayed by him, and the Mongols
would not have become lords of the Great Steppe in the course of two years. That
is what Chinggis thanks Jamuqa for, that in the enemy camp he helped him achieve
victory; consequently, Jamuqa's utterances are not directed at the khan's ears,
but at the widest dissemination among Mongol society. Then: &quot;What is my
friendship to you, when the whole world is before you? You will, of course,
dream of me in the dark nights. I shall, of course, oppress your thoughts in the
light of day. I have become a louse behind your collar, or a thorn in your
hem.&quot; This is convincing as the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{259}
</font></b>words or thoughts of Chinggis himself, but not of
Jamuqa. A blown agent is of no use, many obstacles can be foreseen and it is
easier to be rid of him, even if only to avoid compromising conversations with
wide repercussions. But from Jamuqa's point of view? He helped the khan to
achieve victory, and clearly not in order to become its victim. To be killed by
his friend is more shameful than to fall at the hands of the enemy. Therefore,
the interpretation of the Secret History seems doubtful to me and I think that
its author put the khan's thoughts, or those of his closest advisers and noyans,
in Jamuqa's mouth. And he did this to remove from them the responsibility for
the execution of the prisoner - he himself, he said, wanted this. But he did not
start to speak badly of the executed man, because none of those in the know
would have believed this, and the interpretation of the events would have come
under suspicion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Faith in History</h4>
<p>It is well known that historical necessity and chance are
neighbours, but to apply this thesis in particular circumstances is complex and
demands, if not artistry, at least craftsmanship. In our case, however, it is
this approach which is constructive. The unification of the steppe was a
historical necessity, but that it was not the Kerait, Naiman or Kara-Khitan, but
the Mongols who fulfilled this task -there we have a series of chances
determined by a combination of the will and feelings of many participants in the
events.</p>
<p>Chinggiskhan's army, or the party of the &quot;people of long
will&quot;, was weaker, not merely than the Kerait and Naiman khanates, or the
Merkit and Tatar tribal alliances, but even than their own anti-Chinggis Mongol
aristocracy and, as we have seen, the victory went to Chinggis thanks to his
endurance, skilful diplomacy, ability to attract and foster the men he needed
and to the help of Jamuqa-sechen without which the nine-tailed white banner
would have been dragged in the grass along with the khan's severed head. Then
the &quot;kingdom of the pontiff John&quot; would have changed from a dream into
reality, but the general course of history would have been violated only in
details. Well, there would have been less on some distant campaigns, and
somewhat more written literary and historical texts.</p>
<p>For our subject, though, the Mongol victory is a fact of
enormous significance, because their ideological system was incompatible <b><font COLOR="#943634">{260}
</font></b>with Christianity. This did not mean that Mongols and
Nestorians were unable to get along with one another on the same grazing grounds
or go on distant campaigns shoulder to shoulder. But this meant that both
religions had to make room so as not to hinder one another, and Chinggiskhan
understood this before all his companions and perhaps also his conquered
opponents.</p>
<p>Mongol religious understanding was by no means a primitive
pagan faith or the practice of shamanist exultation. At the head of the cult
were soothsayers who had enormous influence and limited the power of the khans.
About 1207 the wizard Kokochu,  <a name="sik4text58"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note58">[+58]</a> son of one of Chinggiskhan's first
associates, Monglik, evidently overestimating his influence among the people,
beat up the khan's brother, Qasar, with the help of his own six brothers and
then slandered him, foretelling to Chinggiskhan that Qasar would take the throne
from him. Only the intervention of the queen, his mother, saved Qasar from
execution, but not from disgrace. After this Kokochu became insolent and started
to entice people from among those subordinate to the princes of the khan's clan.
When Chinggis's step-brother, Temuge-otchigin, demanded his people back, Kokochu
and his brothers were made to beg for forgiveness on their knees. At Otchigin's
request Chinggiskhan summoned to his headquarters the retainers who had gone too
far, the wizard's spine was broken, while his father and brothers were given a
dressing down and forgiven. According to the Secret History the wizard's body
was carried off to heaven, but Chinggiskhan explained that Tenggeri (heaven),
disliking him, took away not only his soul, but his body as well. Afterwards the
executed man's relatives became quiet<a name="sik4text58a"></a><a href="sik4b.htm#sik4note58a">[+58a]</a> and the conflict between the
spiritual and lay authorities ended in favour of the latter.</p>
<p>The Nestorians benefited as a result of this brief and tragic
history, since Chinggis and his successors began to enlist their services for
the state, without asking them to renounce their faith. Nevertheless, the empire
that was created can by no means be called a Christian one; and now we have to
turn our attention to the deity in ancient Mongol religion who was Christ's
competitor. That same deity for whose victory Jamaqa-sechen perished.</p>
