<h3><a name="sik2para05">5. The Shattered Silence (961-1100)</a></h3>
<h4>By The Great Wall of China</h4>
<p>In the previous chapter we proposed a conception of the
history of the Five Dynasties as a struggle between the cosmopolitan traditions
of the Tang empire and the Chinese nationalism which had achieved victory by
960. The remnant of the Turkic Shato, fighting for Tang traditions thanks to
which they were able to exist on Chinese territory, held on in the north of
Shanxi but, despite Khitan help, this kingdom (the Bei-Han) was destroyed in
979.</p>
<p>The Sinicized steppe dwellers were in a desperate situation,
since the occupation of their lands by the Song troops boded no good for them,
and they could not retreat north since they had lost the traditions of a nomad
way of life. Therefore, they had to organise resistance and seek a suitable form
of ideology to achieve success and, as Chinese medieval tradition demanded, to
establish a succession from one of the former dynasties. The Tangut, the
population of the Ordos and Alashan compounded of the fragments of many border
tribes, undertook the initiative in organising resistance. During the
suppression of Huang Chao's rebellion, the Tangut came out in support of the
Tang dynasty and, together with the Turkic Shato, were victorious. Princes
bearing the name Toba were their leaders. They derived their clan from the Wei
dynasty which ruled Northern China from 386 to 557.  <a name="sik2text58"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note58">[+58]</a>
Whether this genealogy was invented  <a name="sik2text59"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note59">[+59]</a> or real,
 <a name="sik2text60"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note60">[+60]</a> it played its part.  <a name="sik2text61"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note61">[+61]</a> The Tibetan
speaking tribes of the Minyag, known to the Chinese as Dansyan and to the
Mongols <b><font COLOR="#943634">{79} </font></b>and Turks as Tangut, left the
Valley of the Tao He and Weishui and settled in the Ordos and Alashan in the
middle of the seventh century. Here they multiplied and grew rich, acquired
livestock, but did not combine into a single state. The north-eastern tribes
living in Chakhar were conquered by the Khitan; the western ones occupying Gansu
maintained an alliance with China, and only their central group showed a
tendency to independence. In 873 these Tangut took the town of Xiazhou and were
recognised as an independent vassal principality for their help to the Tang
dynasty against Huang Chao in 884. Subsequently they entered the Later Tang
Empire, though purely nominally, ruled by their own princes who for form's sake
received Chinese ranks. The Tangut took no part in the war between the Shato and
the Chinese and grew in strength and power as a result of this isolation.</p>
<p>The unification of the whole of China by the Song dynasty set
the Tangut a very old dilemma: to return to Chinese protection or achieve
independence. Toba Zi-peng, favouring the first solution, appeared at Kaifeng
with a proposal for submission, but his relative, Toba Zi-qian, headed a rising
against the Chinese who had introduced troops into the Tangut lands, i.e. the
Ordos, in 982. At first he met with defeats and had to save himself by flying
from the Chinese troops. But &quot;the inhabitants of the west who had had great
favours from the Toba clan joined him in numbers&quot;,
 <a name="sik2text62"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note62">[+62]</a> and the Chinese began to suffer defeats. In 985 a powerful army was
thrown against the Tangut and caused them much loss, but it was defeated the
same year. Then the Tangut concluded an alliance with the Khitan and again
defeated the Chinese in 987. The subsequent military actions of the Tangut were
so successful that the emperor ordered the fortress of Xiazhou to be destroyed,
thus conceding Western Gansu and the Ordos to the Tangut. In 990 the new Tangut
state was acknowledged by the Liao Empire and its independent existence dates
from then.</p>
<p>We shall not follow the upheavals of the ceaseless war
between the Tangut and China since this would violate the scale and degree of
approximation we have chosen. Yet it is essential to shade in the part played by
the Tangut-Chinese war in the general historical process. The Tangut themselves
considered they were the heirs of the half foreign dynasties of Bei-Wei and
Tang, as well as of the Shato <b><font COLOR="#943634">{80} </font></b>dynasties
of the Later (Hou) Tang and Later (Hou) Jin, and they defended the same
political platform - the right of non-Chinese to live on territories once seized
by China, to preserve their own historical traditions to be ruled by leaders
from their own milieu and not by Chinese officials. However, the truly Tibetan
tribes in Gansu and Amdo were their enemies. During a war with the Gansu
Tibetans Toba Zi-qian was seriously wounded by an arrow in the face and died a
year later in 1004. His son, Toba De-ming, entered into negotiations with the
Song Empire and achieved a peace in 1006 in accordance with which he was granted
the ranks of military governor and grand prince, as well as gifts of money,
textiles and tea merely for the fact that he agreed not to count himself a
sovereign ruler.  <a name="sik2text63"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note63">[+63]</a></p>
<p>The Tangut used the breathing space to secure their western
frontier. De-ming's son, Yuan-hao, a talented commander, drove the Uighur from
Ganzhou in 1028 and seized Dunhuang in 1035. The fighting was extremely fierce
because there was blood enmity between the Uighur and Tangut  <a name="sik2text64"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note64">[+64]</a>
and this was felt more keenly by the steppe peoples than was political, economic
or religious competition. No prisoners were taken; &quot;blood flowed like a
murmuring stream&quot;.  <a name="sik2text65"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note65">[+65]</a> But the successful
westward penetration of the Tangut was interrupted also by the Tibetans, blood
enemies of the Tangut. The Tibetan tribes, defeated in the foothills of the
Nanshan, combined in the hills of Amdo and on the shores of Lake Koko Nor into
the Tubot kingdom.</p>
<p>A descendant of the ancient Tibetan kings, Gosrai (Guo-si-luo)
headed the united tribes and advanced against the Tangut kingdom &quot;in
expectation of rewards and honours from the Chinese court&quot;.  <a name="sik2text66"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note66">[+66]</a>
Perhaps not only for that reason, even though, undoubtedly, an alliance with
China suited him, for &quot;our enemies&quot; enemies are our friends&quot;.
Yuan-hao's attack on Gosrai in 1035 ended in failure for the Tangut. Gosrai
repulsed them and after his victory the Gansu Tibetans and Uighur, who had not
had an easy time under the power of the Tangut, began to join him. In 1041 the
Gansu Uighur who had fled to Turfan during the Tangut offensive attempted to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{81}
</font></b>free their homeland from the conquerors. They attacked the oasis of
Shazhou and besieged the fortress where there was a Tangut garrison But the
Tangut threw their armoured cavalry westward and obliged the Uighur to raise the
siege and return to Turfan  <a name="sik2text67"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note67">[+67]</a> where the silent
sand dunes and shifting desert sands defended them from the Tangut spears.
Thanks to this diversion the ephemeral Tubot kingdom was saved, but Gosrai, even
with his reinforcements and allies, was unable to deal with the organised army
of Yuan-hao. He was obliged to limit himself to the defence of his mountain
forts and to plundering raids on the Tangut kingdom. <a name="sik2text68"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note68">[+68]</a></p>
<p>It seems that the strength of the Tangut was determined by
two mutually linked circumstances: a positive political programme and a body of
people delighted with it. The prince Yuan-hao prompted his peace-loving father,
De-ming, to war with China which paid for peace in silk by saying: &quot;To
dress in hides and wool, to engage in herding that is what to be a nomad means.
He who is born a hero should dominate others; what is the point of silks?&quot;
A still clearer programme of cultural self-determination is expressed in
comparing 1.ingut and the Khitan who had absorbed Chinese civilisation like a
sponge: &quot;the Yan [i.e. Khitan settled around Beijing - LG] imitate the
Chinese in clothing, food and drink. The Tangut do not like China and use such
customs and usages as they think fit&quot;  <a name="sik2text69"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note69">[+69]</a>
(i.e. their own - LG).</p>
<p>This emotional declamation was not uttered in vain. Here,
with utter clarity, it was declared that the aim of life was not one's
well-being, and not blessed peace, but struggle against the eternal enemy <b><font COLOR="#943634">{82}
</font></b>of the nomads, against the enemy of their ancestors, i.e. the
Toba-Wei dynasty, which had once come from the steppes of Trans-Baikal, seized
half of China and fell a victim to its subjects. This was a still more extreme
programme than that of the Turkic Shato and it was carried out more
consistently. Instead of a compromise with Chinese culture Yuan-hao carried out
a series of reforms with which he destroyed all the borrowings from China: he
replaced the Chinese calendar by his own which was invented at that time; he
rejected the Chinese name he had been granted; he created a Tan-gut corps of
officials, a Tangut army and Tangut writing which, although hieroglyphic,
differed from the Chinese. Finally, he took a chance and at the end of 1038
declared himself &quot;Son of Heaven&quot; and called his kingdom the Western
Xia empire, referring to his descent from the house of Toba-Wei. This meant war
with China where they could not bear the existence on earth of an empire other
than the Middle one. The war continued until 1044 and ended with Yuan-hao
abandoning his magnificent title. The laws of economics proved stronger than
ideas of war and victory. The people grumbled because there was no tea or silk
textiles. Peace and concessions had to be made, but only in formal addresses in
diplomatic correspondence.  <a name="sik2text70"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note70">[+70]</a></p>
<p>Well, what could the half savage Tibetan mountain people,
dreaming merely of &quot;gifts&quot; from the &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;, i.e.
tea, clothing and silk for their wives, oppose to this upsurge of horrors? In
physical bravery and endurance they were not inferior to the Tangut, but they
lacked that upsurge, that burning creative zeal which allowed the small Tangut
principality to conquer the Chinese hordes and create a culture not inferior to
the Chinese. Of course, this could not be achieved merely by the forces of
steppe dwellers and mountain people. China itself came to the help of the Tangut
by driving beyond its limits all dissenters, in the first place the Buddhists
and Christians. The Buddhists found a warm welcome in the Tangut yurts. They
drew pictures, cast statues, composed verses and treatises for the Tangut kings,
and when necessary gave good advice on diplomatic and administrative matters.</p>
<p>As they were impatient of the Chinese who had offended them,
the Buddhists did not hinder the Tangut from honouring the &quot;clairvoyant
spirits&quot; and dead ancestors. Taoists as well as Buddhists <b><font COLOR="#943634">{83}</font></b>
fled from China to Tangut where Confucian treatises were not prohibited.
Tolerance gave the Tangut such a power that they halted Chinese aggression,
protecting themselves with the defenceless Great Steppe, thanks to which the
khanates of the Black Tatars (see below) formed without hindrance in their rear.</p>
<p>Yuan-hao perished in 1048. He was killed by his son whose
bride he had taken away. A confused period ensued dominated by the Liang noble
clan which was unpopular with the troops. In 1082 the Chinese took the fortress
of Lanzhou from the Tangut and put on the throne the old dynasty which
successfully concluded the war with China by a peace in 1106; this was
considerably helped by the quarrel of the Chinese with the Amdo Tibetans and the
fall of Gosrai's kingdom. In a one to one fight the Tangut were the equals of
the Chinese in strength.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The West</h4>
<p>After the fall of the Western Turkut kaganate Karluk
settlements surrounded Lake Issyk-Kul from the south; in the east they reached
the River Tarim. At the end of the ninth century Kasan, on the banks of Kasansai,
a right tributary of the Syrdarya, and Isfijab, in the valley of the River Arys,
 <a name="sik2text71"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note71">[+71]</a> were frontier towns; but at the start of the
tenth &quot;the Turkic Karluk cover Mavarannahr from Isfijab to the furthest
towns of Ferghana&quot;.  <a name="sik2text72"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note72">[+72]</a> This was their
southern frontier. In the north they continued to hold the region of the Seven
Streams, the upper Irtysh and were dominant in the eastern part of present day
Kazakhstan. Of the tribes subject to them the Argu (Argyn, descendants of the
Basmil)  <a name="sik2text73"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note73">[+73]</a> and the Tukhsi, a remnant of the
Turgish in the south-west of the Seven Streams region are known. These were the
most civilised Turkic tribes who had partly become sedentary.</p>
<p>However, the Karluk ruler was not styled <i>khan, </i>but <i>jabgu
</i>and this gives a basis for thinking that the Karluk power was not
particularly strong.</p>
<p>In reality, at the start of the tenth century new tribes
appear on <b><font COLOR="#943634">{84} </font></b>the southern boundary of the
Karluk lands: the Cigil and Yagma. The Cigil practised nomadism around Lake
Issyk-Kul and northeast of it, and the Yagma around Kashgar. Evidently, the
Karluk loss of these territories is connected with clashes with the Uighurs who
temporarily seized Aksu and Barskhan and, with the intervention of the Kirghiz,
drove the Uighurs away.</p>
<p>In their struggle with the Muslim the Karluk also suffered
defeat. In 840 Nukh ibn Asad conquered Isfijab and constructed a wall to defend
the agricultural districts from the nomads. In 893 Ismail Samani took possession
of Talas. In the west the Samanid government rose against the Karluk Guz, the
ancestors of the Turkmen, then called <i>oguzy, </i>which simply means
&quot;clans&quot;.</p>
<p>At the start of the tenth century these descendants of the
Parthians were localised in the lower reaches of the Syrdarya and on the shores
of the Aral Sea. In the Turkut period they changed their language, evidently one
of the Pehlevi dialects, for Turkish, but continued to feel their link with
Eastern Iran and, making an alliance with the Samanids, they made things
difficult for the Karluk. They accepted Islam early and compelled the Karluk to
do the same in 960. The Karluk lost their dominance in the steppe and it passed
to the warlike herders, the Yagma.</p>
<p>Evidently the Turkisation of the Western Territory had begun
at the time the west Turkic khans were dominant there. On a Chinese Tang period
map made at the end of the seventh century, as well as the old name Sule, a new
one, Kasha, i.e. Kashgar, appears. We must suppose that in the alarming period
of the fall of the West Turkiit kaganate the shores of the Kashgardarya were
settled by Turkic nomads, the Nushibi, who had spread south from the Tianshan.  <a name="sik2text74"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note74">[+74]</a>
The newcomeis got on with the population of the oasis, who were not numerous,
intermingled and formed a new tribe, the Yagma, who became known in the early
tenth century. The presence of two racial components in this tribe is distinctly
shown by the contradictions in descriptions of their appearance. The Arab
traveller, Abu-Dulef writes that the Yagma were a bearded people of tall stature
with blue eyes,  <a name="sik2text75"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note75">[+75]</a> but Utbi, an eleventh-century
historian, writes that in 1008 near Balkh the Turks (that is the Yagma) <b><font COLOR="#943634">{85}</font></b>
suffered a defeat; they had &quot;broad faces, small eyes, flat noses, few hairs
in the beard, they had iron swords and were in black clothes.  <a name="sik2text76"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note76">[+76]</a></p>
<p>This discrepancy is fully explicable, if we take into account
that Abu-Dulef was in the town of Kashgar itself and saw the descendants of the
ancient Europeoid population of the oasis, but Utbi saw the ordinary warriors
gathered from the inhabitants of the surroundings.</p>
<p>The Yagma accepted Islam even before the Karluk, in 900, and
thus linked themselves to the western half of Central Asia. Their ruler was
called the Bogra-khan, and the Yagma people were called Bograch.  <a name="sik2text77"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note77">[+77]</a> Contemporaries did not confuse these people either with the Karluk or
with the Uighur. The poem Kudatkubilik, composed by Yusuf Balasagun in 1069 was
written, in S.E. Maslov's opinion, at first in Arabic script, and then
re-written in Uighur writing.  <a name="sik2text78"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note78">[+78]</a> The language of
the poem is distinct from Uighur and is called Bograkhan.  <a name="sik2text79"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note79">[+79]</a>
So, by the start of the tenth century, not only Turf an and Karashar, but also
Kashgar and Yarkend had been Turkified. The Western Territory had become Eastern
Turkestan.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The North-West</h4>
<p>In the Aral-Caspian basin the distribution of forces and
territory had changed no less than in the south.</p>
<p>The disappearance of the iron fist of the West Turkic khans
allowed the weak but warlike nomad tribes to disclose their undissipated
strength. The Kengeres, called the Pecheneg by the Russians, began a war against
the Ugrians dwelling in the Urals and at the start of the ninth century obliged
them to retreat westwards under the protection of the Khazar kingdom.</p>
<p>In the ninth century the warlike Pecheneg horde retained its
dominance in the Yaik basin, but in the south-east they had to wage a ceaseless
war with the Guz and in the west with the Khazars.</p>
<p>In the second half of the ninth century the Khazars and Guz
concluded an alliance and pressed the Pechenegs so hard that part of them living
in Ustyurt bought themselves peace by submission; <b><font COLOR="#943634">{86} </font></b>another
part broke through to the Black Sea steppes and about 890 reached the lower
Danube and in 915 were in contact with Rus', Byzantium and Bulgaria. The Asiatic
lands of the Pechenegs fell to the Guz (they were the Uz, Torks, Turkmen, the
last name became a firm ethnonym only from the eleventh century).</p>
<p>East of the Guz, in the forest-steppe zone from the Irtysh to
the Tobol, the Kimek lived Eastern authors, both Muslim and Chinese, call them
Kipchak. They were numerous and had their own clan organisation at its head
stood a khakan who had eleven subordinate collectors. His summer quarters were
in the town of Kamani whose location is unknown, evidently this was a town of
felt yurts. When in the mid-eleventh century the Kimek penetrated into the Dnepr
region the Russians called them Polovtsy because of the light colour of their
hair <i>(polova </i>is chopped straw), but in west European languages the
ethnonym Koman or Cuman continued to be used for them. These were a mixed people
compounded of the decendants of the Central Asian Hun - Chumugun, Kipchak and
Kengerh.  <a name="sik2text80"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note80">[+80]</a> The Kengerh were the remnants of the
population of ancient Kangyui, and the Kipchak were the western branch of the
Dinhn, a Europeoid people living in the Minusinsk basin even before our era.  <a name="sik2text81"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note81">[+81]</a>
Both of them in the course of 200 years subordination to the Turkut had become
Turkic-speaking (incidentally, I consider the Kipchak had always been) and fused
into a single people which, in the words of Shikhab ad-din Yakhi, a
fourteenth-century geographer, differed &quot;from other Turks by their
religiosity, bravery, rapid movements, fine figure, regular features and noble
nature&quot;.  <a name="sik2text82"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note82">[+82]</a></p>
<p>Subsequently they drove the Guz southwards, the Pechenegs
westwards, the Karluk south-east and the Ugnans to the north into the deep
taiga, and they became lords of the territory of ancient Kangyui which from this
time become the Desht-i-Kipchak, the Kipchak steppe. In the mid-eleventh century
they clashed with the Russian princes and inflicted several heavy defeats on
them, however, crushed by Vladimir Monomakh in 1115 they ceased to pose a real
threat to the Russian land.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{87}</p>
<h4></font></b>A Northern Oasis</h4>
<p>In periods of steppe desiccation, even brief ones, the part
played by oases naturally grew; here the microclimate allowed the population to
maintain its economy and even develop it, because the constant threat from the
steppe weakened as the nomad economy became impoverished. It was thanks to such
a combination of circumstances in the tenth century that the states of the
Uighur Idykut and the Central Asian emirs, the Samanids, grew stronger.</p>
<p>On the northern margin of the steppe two peoples found
themselves in equally favourable circumstances: the Kipchak on the southern
slopes of the Altai and, particularly important, the inhabitants of the central
Onon valley.</p>
<p>The greater part of Eastern Trans-Baikal and the adjacent
areas of Eastern Mongolia are occupied by expansive steppes, and the Onon pine
forest,  <a name="sik2text83"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note83">[+83]</a> with an area of about a thousand square
kilometres, is only an island of forest preserved in the arid climate thanks to
a huge freshwater reservoir being located here in the neocene. The deposits of
ancient streams and lakes show physical and water features allowing trees to
grow which, in their turn, would model the microclimate and vegetational cover.
Defended by sand dunes, wild cherry, dogrose, currants, hawthorn, poplars,
birch, elm, wild apple, Siberian apricot grow, meadows and reedy marches occur
in the depressions and willow thickets on the mountain slopes. Even in the
driest years, when the steppes around are burnt out and the earth cracks from
the heat, the grasses do not disappear from the Onon forest, since ground waters
feed it and scattered hills with heights of 300 to 500 metres defend it against
the dry winds. Here, too, the steady cold steppe winds which pass as dust storms
in spring and autumn are not terrible. Their action is weakened in the depth of
the forests which modify the daily fluctuation in temperature by 2-6╟.</p>
<p>Here, too, animals are abundant, especially birds. Wood
grouse and thrushes, hares and wild goats fill the pine forest, while herds of
antilope-dzeren [south Kirghiz saiga-trans.] annually migrate from Mongolia. In
brief, even in twentieth-century conditions the Onon forest is a resort.</p>
<p>From this description it is understandable that, first, in
type of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{88} </font></b>economy and, consequently, of
culture, the population of the middle Onon should differ from the steppe
dwellers surrounding it; and, second, the drought hitting the steppes in the
ninth to tenth centuries had a minimal effect on the inhabitants of the Onon
area. Therefore, the people living there kept many old traditions and elaborated
an original culture, in some measure similar to the steppe one, but with its own
local differences. This people were called Mongols.</p>
<p>The Mongols, an independent ethnos,  <a name="sik2text84"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note84">[+84]</a>
lived from the first century a.d. in the present day Trans-Baikal area and
North-Eastem Mongolia, north of the Kerulen which separated them from the
Tatars. The tribal name Mongol is of very ancient origin, but references to the
Mongols in Chinese sources are rare, because Siberia was outside the field of
vision of the ancient Chinese geographers. For the first time the Mongols are
referred to as the neighbours of the Sushen, ancestors of the Jurchen, in the <i>Hou
Han shu. </i> <a name="sik2text85"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note85">[+85]</a></p>
<p>According to Mongol legend the Borte-chino (Grey Wolf) and
Goa-maral (Fine Fallow Deer), who crossed the Tengis (internal sea)  <a name="sik2text86"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note86">[+86]</a>
and settled in Onon valley, were ancestors of the core of the Mongol people.
Twelve generations of their descendants left nothing behind them but names;
thus, the son of the founder of the clan was called Batu-Chigan (Unshatterable
White). It is hard to say whether the names Wolf and Fallow Deer are a trace of
ancient zoolatry,  <a name="sik2text87"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note87">[+87]</a> a heritage of totemism or
whether these were protective names given so that the death spirits might not
carry off the children's souls. Evil spirits, according to the Mongols, are
narrowly specialised: some carry off boys, others girls, a third sort animals,
and so on. Therefore, the spirit, hearing an animal's name, would not touch the
child, but the other one specialising in wolves, seeing a human being, would
leave him in peace. In any event, the choice of an animal name was not chance;
it was just the same with the ancient Turks, where animal names were used, but
no one <b><font COLOR="#943634">{89} </font></b>considered their bearers to be
animals. Yet features relating them with wolves or snow leopards were perceived
in the character of those bearing animal names; but this is a nuance of
primitive thinking  <a name="sik2text88"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note88">[+88]</a> which may take us away from
our subject.</p>
<p>Folk memory and sources note an event which took place in the
twelfth generation. The Khori-Tumat tribe joined the nomad camp of the
Mongols&quot; ancestors and one of the most senior Mongols, Dobun-Mergan,
married a Khori-Tumat beauty, Alan-goa. But the tribe did not approve of this
marriage and Dobun-Mergan's children were obliged to set up on their own.</p>
<p>After her husband's death, Alan-goa gave birth to three sons
by, according to her, a light brown man who came to her through the smoke-hole
of the yurt, emitting light from which she became pregnant.  <a name="sik2text89"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note89">[+89]</a>
This legend, on the one hand, has something in common with shamanist dogma about
a spirit's sexual selection of a woman to whom he gave his power,  <a name="sik2text90"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note90">[+90]</a>
and, on the other, is noted in the source to explain why the ancient Mongols
were so dissimilar to all the peoples surrounding them.  <a name="sik2text91"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note91">[+91]</a></p>
<p>According to the testimony of contemporaries, the Mongols, as
distinct from the Tatars, were a people of tall stature, bearded, with light
coloured hair and blue eyes. Their descendants acquired their present day
appearance by mixed marriages with neighbouring tribes who were numerous, of low
stature, black haired and with black eyes. However, the ancient Mongols had
nothing in common with the blond people inhabiting Europe. European travellers
in the thirteenth century found no similarities between the Mongols and
themselves.</p>
<p>A Europeoid anthropological race of the first order is traced
in east Central Asia and Siberia from the upper palaeolithic and originates
genetically from the Cromagnon type, being a particular branch which developed
parallel with the races of Europe and the Near East.  <a name="sik2text92"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note92">[+92]</a>
Against the background of the markedly Mongoloid <b><font COLOR="#943634">{90} </font></b>peoples
of the Amur basin, even weakly marked Europeoid features would appear prominent
to medieval observers and deserving of mention. Nevertheless, these features
could not arise independently; they must have been brought from areas where
Europeoids were the norm, not the exception. The Europeoid Yenisei Kirghiz were
the closest of all to the Mongols, but the Mongols did not consider them their
relatives, although they knew them well as contemporaries and neighbours. So we
have to reject the easiest solution and find another.</p>
<p>Let us glance at ancient history. In A.D. 67 the Hun and
Chinese waged a bitter war for what was known as the Western Territory, i.e. the
oases of the Tarim Basin. The Chinese and their allies won a temporary victory
and destroyed the principality of Cheshi (in the Turf an oasis) which was allied
with the Hun. The Hun Shan-yu [king] collected the remnant of the Cheshi people
and resettled them on the eastern frontier of his power,  <a name="sik2text93"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note93">[+93]</a>
i.e. the Trans-Baikal area.</p>
<p>The Cheshi belonged to the eastern branch of the
Indo-Europeans, evidently close to the eastern Iranians.  <a name="sik2text94"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note94">[+94]</a>
In their homeland they had shocked no one by their appearance. Coming to a
completely different land they had to adapt themselves to it and to some extent
mingle with the local population. In the seventh or eighth century this small
tribe was subjected to the Turks.  <a name="sik2text95"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note95">[+95]</a> During the
domination of the Uighurs they did not disclose their existence in any way, and
only at the end of the tenth century was Bodonchar born, the founder of Mongol
greatness, the son of Alan-goa and the light brown light bearing spirit, the
ninth generation ancestor of Chinggiskhan. The Mongol historian, Perlee,
ascribed his birth to 970.  <a name="sik2text96"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note96">[+96]</a> Coming of age,
Bodonchar, first, acquired the skill of falconry, second, conquered some small
local tribe and, finally, set a beginning to the basic Mongol clans. It is still
difficult to consider Bodonchar a historical person, but he did actually live
and from this time the mythological period of Mongol history can be considered
closed.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{91}</p>
<h4></font></b>Steppe Nomads</h4>
<p>While the Mongols succeeded in surviving the fierce
desiccation of the early tenth century thanks to the optimum conditions of their
physical environment, their steppe neighbours were lucky in another way. As soon
as the monsoons returned to their former track and the steppes became green
again, the nomads had immense opportunities to develop herding and population
growth. From the end of the tenth century the steppe is again settled, but this
time from the Far East, more precisely, from the Amur area. The emigration was
not evoked by climatic changes, but by that cruel regime, hostile to the tribal
system, which the Khitan government established and consistently earned out,
making every effort to create in place of its khanate the empire with the
Chinese name of Liao.</p>
<p>A name commits one The policy of forcible Sinicization evoked
protests both by many Khitan and, chiefly, by the tribes they had conquered.
Those able to do so left for the steppe solely in order to struggle against a
hateful regime This was a group of former Shivei known by the name of Tatars.
They had moved south at the start of the ninth century to the Inshan mountains,
as soon as it became possible they spread westwards to the Kerulen, and in 966
concluded an alliance with the Song Empire  <a name="sik2text97"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note97">[+97]</a>
directed at the Khitan. The Khitan, of course, were much stronger than the
Tatars to whom the Chinese were unable to give any support, even moral, but the
rising of all the Amur region tribes in 965-7 tied down the forces of the Khitan
army. Later, in 973, the Jurchen of the Maritime region rose and the Khitan had
to repulse their attack, but at this time the Bei Han Empire fell, the last
bastion of the Shato and the ally of Liao (979).  <a name="sik2text98"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note98">[+98]</a></p>
<p>In an intense war on two fronts the Khitan were able to
achieve victory. The Chinese army was, after several successes, beaten and
thrown back to its own territory in 979. The Jurchen were routed in 984-5 and at
the same time the Khitan army sent to the west routed a nomad confederation
called Zubu in the <i>Liao shi, </i>the leader of the nomads, bearing the title
of Dalai-khan, was killed.  <a name="sik2text99"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note99">[+99]</a></p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{92}</font></b> What does this strange, clearly non-ethnic
name <i>Zubu </i>mean? Many Chinese historians have sought an answer to this
question. Fen Shen-shun considers the word a collective name for many Central
Asian peoples, in his opinion the eastern Zubu are the Jalair and Tatars, the
western are the Naiman, the northern the Kerait, but he does not know who the
north-western were.  <a name="sik2text100"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note100">[+100]</a></p>
<p>Wang Guowei considers Zubu a Khitan name for the Tatars
because the name disappears with the Khitan, and on the same territory live the
Kerait, Naiman, Merkit &quot;as if they suddenly have historical
significance&quot;.  <a name="sik2text101"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note101">[+101]</a> L.L. Viktorova supposes
that the Zubu are an independent Turkic people, descendants of the Hun.  <a name="sik2text102"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note102">[+102]</a>
But this opinion, perhaps, we do not have to review because a chronological gap
of a thousand years has not been taken into account. The first two opinions may
be accepted with reservations It is by no means necessary to discount the
phenomenon of ethnogenesis Tribes such as the Naiman and Merkit did, in fact,
appear late, no earlier than the twelfth century, and it was evidently then that
they were formed But it is impossible to limit the concept of the Zubu merely to
the Tatars. Many steppe tribes took part in confederations, apart from the
Mongols. Wang Guowei notes that the word <i>Tatar </i>was considered humiliating
in Song China and was, therefore, not used in the Liao Empire Instead of the
ethnonym a descriptive term of Tibetan origin, <i>sog-po - </i>shepherds or
nomads, was used. To this word, incomprehensible to the Khitan, corresponded a
term they used which, in Wittfogel's opinion, was rendered in Chinese characters
as <i>Zubu.</p>
</i>
<p>Their Turkic-speaking neighbours (Blue Turks and Uighurs)
called them Tatars, Muslim authors figuratively named them China Turks (Turkon-i-Chin),
 <a name="sik2text103"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note103">[+103]</a> but the Khitan, recognising the ethnic
relationship and the cultural difference, counted them in their books as <i>nomads,
</i>while their fellow tribesmen who had remained on the shores of the Amur
continued to be called <i>Shivei. </i>But then the Khitan themselves-were a
third branch of this same people who had moved south and accepted a fair share
of the culture of the Middle Empire which we have called by the name of its
enemies - <i>Kitai </i>[the Russian word for China].</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{93}</p>
<h4></font></b>The Deception of Words</h4>
<p>Yet if in our usual name for such a well-known country as
China [i.e. Kitai] lies concealed the name of their worst opponent, what
camouflage lies concealed in the ethnonym of the Tatars? In the eighth century
this term was used as equivalent to a small people's own name, a people related
to the Khitan and Tatab, but distinct from them. In the twelfth century, after
the Tatars had for a time seized political dominance in the steppes, all the
steppe population from the Chinese Wall to the Siberian taiga came to be called
Tatars. But apart from the Tatars in the narrow sense, other tribes lived in the
steppe, some of whom are known to us, but many of whom have left nothing but
their names in Chinese, more precisely Khitan, sources. Alas, it is impossible
to equate these names. Of the famous nomads we must first of all recall the
Kerait, already noticed at the start of the eleventh century. There are no
Naiman. The Tikin people  <a name="sik2text104"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note104">[+104]</a> dwelt on the site of
their future nomadic pastures; these were evidently the descendants of ancient
Turks who had concealed themselves in the Altai.  <a name="sik2text105"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note105">[+105]</a> The
warlike Merkit and Oirat were still settled in the mountain taiga of the Sayan
range, but the Basmil in Dzungaria again began to gather strength and together
with them the Dalidi tribe, of whom nothing is known, except that they perished.
The Shato who survived the carnage concealed themselves in the Chakhar steppes,
and the Dansyan not joining the Tangut kingdom in the area north of the Ordos.
The Khitan called them all Zubu, and the Chinese called them Da-dan, i.e.
Tatars.</p>
<p>In east Central Asia an ethnic name has a double meaning: (1)
the direct naming of an ethnic group (a tribe or people) and (2) a collective
term for a group of tribes forming a specific cultural or political complex,
even if the tribes included in it are of differing origin. Rashid ad-Din noted
this: &quot;Many lines set greatness and worth in the fact that they related
themselves to the Tatars and became known under their name, just as the Naiman,
Jalair, Ongut, Kerait and other tribes who each had their specific name called
themselves Mongols from a desire to transfer the fame of the latter to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{94}
</font></b>themselves; the descendants of these lines puffed themselves up
thinking they had borne this name from ancient times, which was not so in
reality&quot;.  <a name="sik2text106"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note106">[+106]</a></p>
<p>Until the twelfth century leadership among the tribes in
Eastern Mongolia belonged to the Tatars, and therefore the Chinese historians
regarded the Mongols as part of the Tatars in the general sense. In the
thirteenth century the situation changed and the Tatars began to be regarded as
part of the Mongols in the same general sense; moreover, the name <i>Tatar </i>disappeared
in Asia and passed to the Volga Turks, subjects of the Golden Horde, where in
the course of time it became an ethnonym. At the beginning of the thirteenth
century the names <i>Tatar </i>and <i>Mongol </i>were synonyms because, firstly,
the name Tatar was usual and generally known, but the word <i>Mongol </i>was
new; and, secondly, numerous Tatars, in the narrow sense of the word, formed the
advanced detachments of the Mongol force, since they were not spared and were
set in the most dangerous positions. Their opponents encountered them there and
confused the names; for example, Armenian historians called them Mungal-Tatars,
and the Novgorod Chronicle under 6742 (1234) writes: &quot;The same year, for
our sins, unknown heathen came, no one knows them: who they are, where they have
come from, and what their language is, and of what tribe they are; but they call
them Tatars... &quot;  <a name="sik2text107"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note107">[+107]</a> This was the Mongol
army.</p>
<p>Based on the collective meaning of the term <i>Tatar </i>the
medieval Chinese historians divided the eastern nomad peoples into three
sections: the White, Black and Wild Tatars.  <a name="sik2text108"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note108">[+108]</a></p>
<p>The nomads living south of the Gobi Desert, along the Great
Wall, were called White Tatars. The majority of these were the Turkic Ongut
(descendants of the Shato). From their masters, the Khitan, and their neighbours,
the Chinese, these nomads acquired elements of civilisation in place of their
lost independence. They dressed in silk, ate from porcelain and silver dishes,
had hereditary leaders who had learnt Chinese writing and Confucian philosophy.</p>
<p>The Black Tatars, including the Kerait, lived in the steppe
far from cultural centres. Nomadic herding ensured them an adequate, but not
luxurious living, while subjection to the &quot;khans of nature' <b><font COLOR="#943634">{95}</font></b>
gave them independence, but not security. War in the steppe did not cease and
obliged the Black Tatars to live in close groups, protecting themselves for the
night by a ring of wagons (kuren) with guards around it. However, the Black
disdained and pitied the White because the latter had sold their freedom to
foreigners for silk rags and had purchased the fruits of civilisation by an, in
their view, humiliating slavery.</p>
<p>The Wild Tatars of Southern Siberia engaged in hunting and
fishing; they knew the authority of no khan, but were directed by elders to whom
they voluntarily subjected themselves. Hunger and want constantly lay in wait
for them, but they sympathised with the Black Tatars who had to look after their
herds, obey the khans and take account of numerous relatives. To give one's
daughter in marriage to a Black Tatar was considered a terrible punishment for
the girl, who sometimes preferred suicide to the necessity to milk ewes and full
felt. The Mongols lived on the border between the Black and the Wild Tatars, as
a transitional link between them both.</p>
<p>Among the &quot;wild&quot; tribes, i.e. the hunters and
fishers, were included the ancient Uriangqai living in Eastern Siberia and the
Ugi people on the Amur,  <a name="sik2text109"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note109">[+109]</a> as well as numerous
and scattered tribes, forest peoples, living north of the Sayan range. The
latter, evidently, were not included in the concept <i>Zubu, </i>but all the
others were undoubtedly considered Zubu-nomads and as such bore the
responsibility for the policy effected by their leaders. We shall now see what
this meant for them.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>A War for Freedom</h4>
<p>As soon as the Khitan recovered from their internal shocks
they set about the nomads seriously. The nomad leader Hunyan was seized and
executed in 1000. His successor brought the tribes into submission to the Liao
Empire and, in 1003, the Khitan erected the fortress of Hotun on the shores of
the Orkhon to keep watch on the nomads. In 1005 the Tokuz-Tatars sent tribute to
the Khitan, and in</p>
<p>1007 a Khitan punitive expedition turned the steppe nomads (Zubu)
who had evidently not paid tribute to flight. Towards the end of</p>
<p>1008 this detachment attacked the Uighur settlements in
present-day Gansu, but the ferocity of the Khitan evoked a universal rising <b><font COLOR="#943634">{96}
</font></b>by all the nomad tribes in the rear of the expedition. Early in 1013
the Tatars and Dansyan rose, but, not achieving any real successes, they left
for the depths of the steppe, again becoming independent.</p>
<p>However, the threat of Khitan aggression was so great that
the nomads tried to make their way westwards and, at the end of 1013 to early
1014, they fell on Yarkend. Here the Karluk, who had become Muslim, met them and
after a four-year war drove them back into the steppe.
 <a name="sik2text110"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note110">[+110]</a> The nomads were only saved from Khitan vengeance and punishment by
the next rising of the Amur tribes, which lasted two years (1014-15), and the
conflict between the Khitan and the Koreans, who achieved a complete and
brilliant victory.</p>
<p>Under the stimulus of this brutal war, when the Liao Empire
Buddhists, the Song Empire Confucians and the Central Asian Muslims became
enemies of the nomads, the latter found an intellectual rallying point and means
of overcoming tribal differences in the preaching of the monks who, not long
before, had been driven from China and had found no refuge.</p>
<p>The Kerait accepted baptism from Nestorian preachers in 1009.
These were the largest and most cultured of the Mongol-speaking peoples in east
Central Asia; they lived on the shores of the Orkhon, Tola and Ongin, in the
same place where once the Hun, Turks and Uighurs had established their powers.
The number of adult Kerait at the start of the eleventh century has been
estimated to be 200,000 who, according to legend, accepted Christianity.
 <a name="sik2text111"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note111">[+111]</a> So, taking account of the children and the aged, they were twice as
many.</p>
<p>According to legend, the conversion of the Kerait took place
because their khan was lost in the desert and St Sergius appeared to him and
showed him the way home. The khan was christened with all his people and took
the name Marguz (Mark). The Metropolitan of Merv was immediately informed of
this event and encountered the question: how were nomads to observe days of
abstinence when they had no vegetable food in general. The Metropolitan asked
the Nestorian Patriarch in Baghdad, John VI (d. 1011) about this important
canonical case and sent the Kerait the explanation that <b><font COLOR="#943634">{97}
</font></b>during fasts they should abstain only from meat, but milk products
might be used as food.</p>
<p>At approximately the same time the Turkic Ongut accepted
Christianity; they were the descendants of the warlike Turkic Shato,
 <a name="sik2text112"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note112">[+112]</a> the last fragment of the Hun. The Ongut lived along the Great Wall,
in the Inshan Mountains, and served the Manchurian emperors of the Kin (Jin)
dynasty as frontier guards. Like many other nomad tribes, the Ongut willingly
borrowed the material benefits of Chinese civilization, but categorically
refused Chinese spiritual culture and ideology. Therefore, the Nestorians found
them true and fervent proselytes. The Guz and, in part, the Cigil were
christened at the same period.  <a name="sik2text113"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note113">[+113]</a> Christianity
displaced the remnants of Manichaeism among the surviving part of the Uighur
based in Turf an, Marashar and Kucha. Even among the Khitan themselves and the
tribes of Western Manchuria subordinate to them &quot;a certain Christian
element&quot; appeared and this afforded a basis for the rise in medieval Europe
of the legend of the pontiff John.  <a name="sik2text114"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note114">[+114]</a> It is of
great interest that even in the Angara valley on the banks of the winding Unga
with its salty waters, A.P. Okladnikov's expedition found Nestorian burials of
Central Asian Europeoid anthropological type.  <a name="sik2text115"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note115">[+115]</a>
In the eleventh to twelfth centuries this was a region of freedom-loving Merkit.
Only the Mongols occupying the area between the rivers Onon and Kerulen remained
outside the east Christian unity.</p>
<p>It is known the Russian Orthodox missionary activity in
Siberia, despite considerable government support, had very little success. The
results achieved by the Nestorians, acting on their own account and at their own
risk, are all the more surprising. Evidently, they overcame the very great
difficulty of communication between peoples speaking different languages, i.e.
they found words in the language of the local population adequately transmitting
complex <b><font COLOR="#943634">{98} </font></b>Christian concepts.
 <a name="sik2text116"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note116">[+116]</a> Thanks to this they became accepted by the south Siberian herders,
became their intimates and their teaching was taken over organically, without
any measures involving force, for which the Nestorian missionaries had no means.</p>
<p>The difficulties encountered by the Liao Empire in 1014  <a name="sik2text117"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note117">[+117]</a>
and the consolidation of the nomads which undoubtedly took place after the
acceptance of Christianity, as with all other peoples (Russians, Franks,
Anglo-Saxons)  <a name="sik2text118"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note118">[+118]</a> compelled the Khitan government
to modify its appetites and grant the leader of the nomads (Zubu) Uba
 <a name="sik2text119"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note119">[+119]</a> the title of king. After this step a peace reigned which, after
twelve years, was again violated by the Khitan. After making peace with Korea in
1020 and establishing a frontier with it along the Yalu, the Khitan renewed
their interest in the West. This time they turned their attention to the growing
strength of Tangut, but decided to give no cause for a quarrel until they had
surrounded it with their own possessions.  <a name="sik2text120"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note120">[+120]</a> With
this aim they tried to communicate with Mahmud Ghaznavi, but becoming convinced
of the senselessness of this venture they moved their forces against the Uighurs
and seized the town of Ganzhou in 1026. The Tangut came to the rescue and
repulsed the Khitan force, then themselves took Ganzhou and added it to their
possessions.  <a name="sik2text121"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note121">[+121]</a> But while the Khitan force was
moving from Manchuria to Gansu over the steppe it seems to have plundered the
local population, and so the united nomads attacked <b><font COLOR="#943634">{99}
</font></b>the retreating Khitan and caused them considerable loss.<font COLOR="#ff0000">
 <a name="sik2text122"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note122">[+122]</a></font> Encouraged by their success, they tried to irrupt into the
old-established Khitan lands, but were there turned to flight by the regular
troops (1027). After this, peace was restored and for a long time, because the
Khitan forces were engaged in putting down the risings in Bokhai (1029-30).  <a name="sik2text123"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note123">[+123]</a></p>
<p>The nomads were not at all inclined to war and in the
following conflict between the Khitan and the Tangut in 1049 themselves brought
horses as remounts for the Khitan cavalry. At this time the nomads already had a
&quot;great king&quot;,  <a name="sik2text124"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note124">[+124]</a> i.e. the unification
of the steppe had been completed.</p>
<p>It is very curious that Muslim authors giving information
about the transfer to Islam of ten thousand tents of Turks who engaged in
nomadism in present-day Kazakhstan observe that &quot;only Tatars and Khatai [Khitan]
remain infidels&quot;,  <a name="sik2text125"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note125">[+125]</a> thus confirming the
equation of Zubu and Tatars. Evidently, the concept <i>Tatar </i>included the
Kerait and Basmil who, unlike the Karluk, did not become Muslim. This means that
the ethnonym <i>Tatar </i>had taken on a collective meaning.</p>
<p>The subsequent insurrection of the nomads in the terminology
of the <i>Liao shi </i>or, more precisely, their war against the Liao Empire
flared up in 1069.  <a name="sik2text126"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note126">[+126]</a> The Khitan managed to seize
the leader of the nomads and take him to their north-west administration for
punishment.</p>
<p>However, the war did not stop until 1086 when the Khitan
prince, Ye-lu Ren-Xian, commanding the western army, was authorised &quot;to
deal with the Zubu leader on friendly terms&quot;; the latter then concluded a
peace with the Liao Empire.  <a name="sik2text127"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note127">[+127]</a></p>
<p>The final stage of the war started in 1092 when the Khitan
Prince Ye-lu Alusaugu attacked the northern Zubu (Kerait) for an unknown reason.
Mogusy, the leader of all the nomad tribes, who had taken power in 1089,
answered blow for blow. He called the Basmil from Dzungaria, raised the Amur
tribes of the Ugi, and one <b><font COLOR="#943634">{100} </font></b>of his
helpers drove off the Khitan livestock and herds grazing on the western frontier
(1094). Despite these energetic activities, though, he was unable to prevent an
incursion of the Khitan army into the steppe where the Khitan took many women
and children prisoner, and the Tangut, striking at the rear of the nomads, were
victorious and eliminated the Basmil from the war, completing this operation in
1099.  <a name="sik2text128"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note128">[+128]</a></p>
<p>A regular well-trained army is always stronger than levies,
even those made up of natural archers and horsemen. In warfare, as in all
matters, professionalism is mightier than dilettantism. So it is no wonder that
in 1097 the leaders of the various nomad tribes within striking distance of Ye-lu
Alusaugu's forces sought peace and the return of the territory seized by the
Khitan. Early in 1100, Mogusy, deserted by his people, was seized, taken to the
Middle capital of the Liao Empire and there, in the market-place, cut to pieces
before a crowd of people celebrating the victory.</p>
<p>A Chinese source describes this bloody period thus:
&quot;This period is famed for its tranquillity. Both in the north and in the
south battles were forgotten; all were concerned only to preserve their
authority internally and to eliminate strife that occurs from division; they
tried to display their prowess by attracting foreigners by kindness and in
imitation of the virtues of their ancestors whom they placed among the sages.
One may say that at that time [the Khitan] achieved a certain perfection.
 <a name="sik2text129"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note129">[+129]</a></p>
<p>No, there is no conscious deception here. That was how the
chronicler perceived the period; as for the nomads imprisoned and miserable,
dying from wounds in the steppes, their families deprived of herds and homes,
and their leader tormented in front of all, well, each one of us has sufficient
strength to bear the sufferings of a neighbour. The historians, educated in
Chinese classical historiography, truly regarded the war against the Kerait as a
hunt for wild animals. But we see in them people and therefore can state that in
the Sinicized Liao Empire the force of law gave way to the law of force. The
Khitan finally achieved victory, but they bought it at too high a price. The
decline of the dynasty which had carried out a policy of Sinicizing the land and
suppressing local traditions became obvious. The confederation of the nomad
tribes fell apart, but a <b><font COLOR="#943634">{101} </font></b>small scale
war continued until 1119, i.e. after the Liao Empire was reeling from the blows
of the Jurchen who had risen in 1114.</p>
<p>The upheavals of this war are not relevant to our subject and
have been described vividly and in detail by A. P. Okladnikov,
 <a name="sik2text130"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note130">[+130]</a> so we shall restrict ourselves to a brief but emotional quotation
from a source on the history of the Liao dynasty which contains a retrospective
analysis of the events. &quot;How strong were the Khitan when they held the
whole province of Yan and when all foreigners submitted to them! How weak they
were under the senseless and underage ruler, Tian-zuo (1101-25), when the Nu-zhi
[Jurchen - L.G.] freely penetrated their possessions and the structure of their
monarchy fell apart at their shout alone! We shall not forget, however, that war
is an unlucky weapon and that the forethought of heaven has evidently decided
that all shall pass from one state to another; when they reach perfect
well-being, the period of decline begins; this is the common rule for all. Thus,
as loudly as the Khitan were elevated, so suddenly did they fall. How
piteous!&quot;  <a name="sik2text131"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note131">[+131]</a></p>
<p>In reality, the Liao Empire, shaken by internal disturbances,
the dynasty which had broken with its people's traditions, showed little
resistance to the Jurchen and fell in 1125, leaving the already uncoordinated
nomads to face a powerful new enemy.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Prototype of John's Kingdom</h4>
<p>Not for nothing have we followed the history of the nomad
confederation of the Zubu or Tatars. For this was the seed from which grew the
legend of the king-pontiff John. Everything fits yet all is dissimilar. Instead
of a mighty empire, menacing to all enemies of the Christian faith, a crowd of
nomads heroically defending their freedom and way of life; instead of untold
wealth, yurts and sheepskins worn with the fleece inwards; instead of an
abundance of nature's gifts, the border of the desert; and, the main thing, no
good could come to any of the Europeans from such co-religionists. That is the
answer to the question: why in both Catholic and Orthodox Europe before the
mid-twelfth century did no interest arise in the Far East? It was not difficult
to obtain adequate information. Caravans regularly passed from China to Baghdad
and then to <b><font COLOR="#943634">{102} </font></b>Constantinople Muslim
merchants reached Siberia, Nestorian ones held the trade between Central Asia
and China in their hands An exchange of information was possible, but the quick
and practical Europeans showed no interest in it They were up to their necks in
their own squabbles</p>
<p>In the west the Normans seized part of France, then England
and Southern Italy In the Holy Roman Empire the emperor now went to Canossa to
pay homage to the Pope, now drove the Pope from the Eternal City and replaced
him with his own protege whom the feudal lords, the real holders of power, did
not want to recognise Byzantium went from victory to victory It coped with
Bulgaria with the help of Rus', with Rus' with the co-operation of the Pechenegs
It united to itself Serbia, Armenia and Georgia, crowning its military successes
with the conversion of Rus' and this set a limit to the spread of the Latins to
the east and introduced a creative, flourishing country to its own culture
Ideological penetration was much cheaper and much more effective than military
conquests.</p>
<p>In the eleventh century Orthodoxy penetrated into Central
Asia there was an Orthodox metropolitan in Merv and, not far away, in Samarkand
there was a Nestorian metropolitan Evidently a certain number of Orthodox
appeared in Khwarizm, too, because there on the 4th of June roses were brought
to the church to commemorate that day when Mary brought roses to the mother of
John the Baptist  <a name="sik2text132"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note132">[+132]</a> A cold war was, evidently,
carried on between the Orthodox and the Nestorians In 1142 the Jacobites joined
the Nestorians, and the only factor linking these two creeds was their hatred of
Byzantine Orthodoxy.</p>
<p>The Arabs, naturally, took the side of the Nestorians whose
Catholicos had, since 987, declared himself a calif In 1062-72 the calif laid it
down that priors of monasteries of the Jacobites (monophysites) and the Melkites
(Orthodox) were subordinate to the Nestorian Catholicos When at war with the
Greeks, the Arabs regarded the Nestorians as their allies and demanded that they
say prayers for their victory  <a name="sik2text133"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note133">[+133]</a> For a long time
the Europeans failed to count the Asiatic Christians as a serious force Of the
Nestorians they only knew they were abettors of the Arabs in their war against <b><font COLOR="#943634">{103}
</font></b>the Christians, but were of little account and did not deserve
attention.</p>
<p>Yet the Nestorians spread and, by the beginning of the
twelfth century, formed a cultural bloc, though one that was politically varied.
The victory of the Jurchen and the formation of the Kin (Jin) Empire were a
heavy blow for the nomads, but the main forces of their enemies drew China off
and in the early twelfth century the Jurchen were fairly passive as regards the
steppe. Only in 1135 did they declare war on the nomads who on this occasion
were headed by the Mongols. In 1139 they inflicted a defeat on the Jurchen at
Mount Hailin which made them halt their advance in China and divert part of
their forces to the northern frontier. Yet this did not save the Song Empire
which in 1141 recognised itself as a vassal of the Kin Empire. After the victory
over the Chinese, the Jurchen renewed the war with the Mongols which lasted till
1147 and ended in victory for the Mongols defending the Great Steppe where the
Nestorian church flourished and grew strong.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>An Attempt at Ethnological Generalisation</h4>
<p>Now we shall glance at the events taking place in Europe
during the same period. This will just be a bird's eye view because it is
important for our subject to catch the general direction in which events
developed, i.e. to take the degree of approximation at which details compensate
one another. Moreover, only one phenomenon interests us: the ethnic and cultural
divergence of the European ethnic group expressed in the schism of the church
and in the appearance of a new super-ethnic unity with a Romano-German content.</p>
<p>We left Eastern Europe at the moment when Jewish Khazaria
triumphed and took the lead. Rus' was oppressed by the situation, sought allies
and in 961 Bishop Adalbert, emissary of Otto I, arrived in Kiev.
 <a name="sik2text134"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note134">[+134]</a> He was received by princess Ol'ga, but his preaching had no success.
Rus' remained in the stream of Byzantine policy, the more so since the interests
of Kiev and Constantinople coincided.</p>
<p>By the single campaign of 965 Svyatoslav dealt with the
existence of the Jewish government of Khazaria, the faithful ally of the Muslim
East. But the Russian prince was unable to maintain himself <b><font COLOR="#943634">{104}
</font></b>on the conquered lands: the lower reaches of the Volga were seized by
the Khwarizm people,  <a name="sik2text135"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note135">[+135]</a> the steppes of the
watershed by the Guz, and the Khazars, saved by the Russians from an unpopular
government, retained the valleys of the Don and Terek.
 <a name="sik2text136"></a><a href="sik2b.htm#sik2note136">[+136]</a> Deprived of a unifying principle, the steppe ceased to threaten the
independence of the Russian states, and this allowed Svyatoslav to carry out
Byzantium's second task - to rout Bulgaria. But, carried away by his successes,
he entered into a conflict with John Tzimisces, was defeated and perished in 972
at the hands of the Pechenegs as he returned to Kiev. There was no damage to the
Russian land in this defeat, because the rejection of an adventurist policy in
the Balkans allowed Vladimir the Bright Sun to strengthen substantially the
borders of Rus' and ensure its economic and cultural growth.</p>
<p>Byzantium achieved its most brilliant victory in 988-9
without shedding a drop of blood. Vladimir, Grand Prince of Kiev, accepted
baptism, and the culture linked with it, from the hands of the Greek monks. But
Byzantium lost influence in Western Europe.</p>
<p>In 962 the German king Otto I was crowned Emperor in Rome.
This was not so much a fact as a symbol by which Romano-German Europe again,
after Charlemagne, declared its independence and equality with Byzantium. The
coronation of Otto I is neither a beginning nor an end, but a transitional point
in the particularisation of the western cultural world. This break had been
prepared through the whole of the tenth century. Shaven fathers in their white
soutanes had contended with bearded monks in black cassocks for the souls of
Slav and Hungarian pagans.</p>
<p>A noteworthy date was the schism in the church in 1054 which
was accompanied by mutual anathemas. There were absolutely no theological
reasons for these, but the schism had been evoked by a combination of social,
economic, political and ideological causes. The church reacted, like a sensitive
barometer, to the ethnic and superethnic divergence of West and East; but the
population, both there and here, including emperors and kings, townsmen and
knights, still more the peasants, with the lack of active thought inherent in
philistines, were unable to understand for a long time that a single
Christianity had ceased to exist. And this natural inertia coloured the nature
of the events which the First Crusade involved. <b><font COLOR="#943634">{105} </font></b>The
crusaders, without thinking of the schism in the Church, went to the aid of the
Greek Christians, and they were awaiting the help of their western
co-religionists. It required about a hundred years for the fact of the schism,
not only in the Church, but in politics and, more than that, ethnically, to
become a dominant psychological factor in social consciousness. But we shall
deal with that in our own time.</p>

Chinese ([Bichunn] Iakinf, <i>istoriya Tibeta)</i>, or Juesiluo in its modern
pronunciation (E.I. Kychanov, <i>Ocherk istorii) </i>It seems to us
inappropriate to transmit the non-Chinese names, l e phonemes, in modern
versions of the characters, since this would merely complicate the onomastic
problems which are complex enough as it is E I Kychanov thinks that Gosylo
(Juesiluo) is not a name, but a title meaning &quot;Son of the Buddha&quot; (<i>Ocherk
istorii, </i>137) Ts. Damdinsuren <i>(Istoricheskie korni Geseriady) </i>identifies
him with the legendary Geser, but apart from a lack of coincidence in name,
origin and biography, this conception is refuted by the statement in a Ladakh
chronicle that the descendants of Geser ruled in Ladakh in 950 (A.H. Francke, <i>A
History of Western Tibet, </i>47) The Tibetans themselves dated Geser as fourth
or fifth century (C. Bell, <i>The Religion of Tibet, </i>14) and this is most
probable (see L.N. Gumilev, &quot;Dinlinskaya problema&quot;, <i>Izvestiya

rightly notes in his famous story. &quot;On the Edge of the World&quot; that the
