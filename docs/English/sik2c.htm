(1100-1143)</a></h3>
<h4>Another Approach</h4>
<p>As distinct from the preceding 150-year dark and empty period
in the history of the Great Steppe, the first half of the twelfth century is
full of events, of the names of heroes and cowards, of places and peoples, and
even of moral and ethical evaluations. This does not, of course, mean that we
have enough material to understand the rhythm of the period; on the contrary, it
is clearly inadequate. But even what there is allows us to give something more
than the general process of historical development - now we can seize the causal
and sequential link between events.</p>
<p>The sources on this period are extremely varied and differ
widely. There is the dynastic chronicle <i>Liao shi, </i>dry and canonical,
giving facts that are confirmed but inadequate. There are several supplementary
Chinese works in which the important and valuable is wondrously intertwined with
trivialities and chance associations. There is a selection of Persian and Arab
histories and, finally, the legend of John the pontiff-king in Latin and Russian
variants.</p>
<p>One lifetime would be insufficient to extract, translate and
systematise all the information needed by the historian; fortunately, two men
have tackled it: Karl Wittfogel and Feng Chia-Sheng. They have made a selection
of the facts and successfully arranged them in tabular form.
 <a name="sik2text137"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note137">[+137]</a> These tables and their notes are the foundations of the structure on
which we can begin to raise the walls.</p>
<p>By walls we mean an articulated account of events, the middle
link of our investigation, after which we can pose the questions: why? and what
was the point? - the roof of our building. But we shall be consistent and for
the time being limit ourselves to what is before us.</p>

<p>{107}</p>
<h4></font></b>A Prince's Career</h4>
<p>Our hero, Ye-lu Dashi, was born in 1087 in the ruling family
of the Liao Empire. He was a descendant of the founder of the dynasty, Ye-lu
Ambagan, in the eighth generation. Before obtaining a rank and an official post,
the young prince had to follow a complete course in Chinese and Khitan language
and literature in the Han-lin Academy. Despite the fact that he left there with
a fine knowledge of literature, this did not prevent his becoming a wonderful
horseman and archer. It is difficult to say which of his specialisms was of most
use to him.</p>
<p>In 1115 Ye-lu Dashi obtained a rank and was appointed
governor of the regions of Dai and Xiazhou (in present-day Shaanxi). War with
the Jurchen, who were rebelling, was in Ml flood, but the front line was still
in the north, in the depths of Manchuria, and the twenty-eight-year-old regent
took no part in these battles. Only in 1122 did he manage to encounter the new
Emperor of the Liao dynasty who arrived in his Southern capital while saving
himself from the pursuing Jurchen. <a name="sik2text138"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note138">[+138]</a> Yet even
there the emperor of a once great power found no rest; he soon fled, roamed
around the country's borders and in 1125 was captured and he died in exile.</p>
<p>The government of the Chinese Song Empire, once again
displaying its political short-sightedness, decided to take advantage of the
difficult situation of the Khitan and stab them in the back. The Chinese
emissaries negotiated with the Jurchen about a simultaneous attack on the
southern regions of the Liao Empire and timed it for 1122. The Chinese
commander, Tong Guan, set out at the head of a large army against which Ye-lu
Dashi could field only two thousand Khitan and Tatab horsemen. Yet this was
enough; the Chinese were completely routed. After the victory, Ye-lu Dashi's
army grew to thirty thousand horsemen drawn from his region whose population
once more had faith in Khitan prowess.</p>
<p>The Song several more times tried to attack the Khitan and
the corpses of Chinese warriors carpeted the earth between the regions of Xuan
and Mo (in Northern China). One can believe this since the Chinese brought their
forces up to half a million after their first army had been defeated. It is
quite clear that these were mobilised <b><font COLOR="#943634">{108} </font></b>peasants
whom there was no time to train Naturally, they fell a sacrifice to the veterans
of Ye-lu Dashi's troops.</p>
<p>The victories achieved almost saved the Liao Empire The
Tangut, drawing close to the Khitan in joint wars against the Zubu (1099) and
concluding an alliance with them strengthened by a marriage (1104), considered
it worthwhile to stand forth in defence of their friends who had again shown
themselves capable of winning victories A thirty thousand strong Tangut army
entered Khitan territory and routed the advance detachments of the Jurchen, but
in a decisive battle on the river Yishui they suffered defeat and were forced
back to the Huang He  <a name="sik2text139"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note139">[+139]</a>.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, despite a terrible defeat, the Tangut continued
to help the Khitan forces pushed back to the western, i.e. desert, borders of
the Liao Empire. They supplied the Khitan with provisions, received and
concealed fugitives, affording the Khitan hope of a counter-offensive in as much
as Ye-lu Dashi and Xiao Gan were a serious force.</p>
<p>However, as soon as the Jurchen appeared in the south of the
Liao Empire the situation changed radically. The regent of the empire and his
assistants fled to the western borderlands Ye-lu Dashi's comrade, the commander
Xiao Gan, proposed establishing a new system relying on the warlike Tatab, but
Ye-lu Dashi preferred to combine with the emperor Yan-xi. In 1123 he led 7,000
Khitan warriors to the west of Suiyuan, while Xiao Gan declared himself emperor
of the Great Xi, as the warlike tribe of the Tatab were called in Chinese. The
fate of the two comrades in arms had become separated.</p>
<p>The Jurchen were not only bold warriors, but also skilful
diplomats. Trying to smash the Tangut-Khitan alliance, they offered the Tangut
several Khitan border regions in exchange for neutrality. The Tangut agreed
joyfully, but the regions &quot;given&quot; turned out to be occupied by troops
of the Song Empire, allies of the Jurchen. The Tangut did not engage in a
conflict with China, restricting themselves to complaints to the Jurchen monarch
about his unfulfilled promises. Precious time was lost on negotiations about
effective help to the Khitan who had still not laid down their arms.</p>
<p>The Emperor Yan-xi attempted to establish order in his camp
He <b><font COLOR="#943634">{109} </font></b>executed the deserter-regent and
loaded Ye-lu Dashi with reproaches for leaving his post. Dashi was able to
justify himself and was again set at the head of the troops sent to the east, to
Chakhar, to recover his homeland. There he clashed with a Jurchen advance guard,
was defeated and captured.</p>
<p>The Jurchen army's task was to seize the Khitan emperor, but
the troops encountered a marshy area and were so tied down that they were unable
to continue the campaign. Then the Jurchen prince, Cong-wang, ordered Dashi, who
was bound, to lead the force to the Emperor of Liao's camp. He did, and although
the Emperor himself was able to escape, his harem, sons, daughters, uncles and
officials were seized by the enemy. The Jurchen emperor Aguda honoured Ye-lu
Dashi for this betrayal and rewarded him with a wife. But here too fate
protected the resourceful prince who was none too fastidious in choosing the
means for his self-preservation.</p>
<p>In the military camp by the Western capital of the former
empire, Ye-lu Dashi beat a Jurchen commander in a game of chance. The commander
was very offended and they quarrelled. Dashi knew the character of his new
friends too well and, losing no time, he took five of his sons and fled, leaving
his wife behind. In the morning, when Dashi's disappearance was discovered, the
unfortunate woman was given to some soldier. When she refused she was shot.</p>
<p>One might think that the Khitan emperor would lament the loss
of all his near ones as a result of Dashi's betrayal, but he received the
fugitive prince with delight, because just at this time the Khitan had planned a
new campaign to recover the Western and Southern capitals from the Jurchen.
Every man knowing the situation in the enemy camp was precious then. Dashi,
understanding matters better, subjected the plan of campaign to severe
criticism. He pointed out that the eastern regions of the country were inundated
with enemy, the defiles in the mountain passes had been ceded without a fight,
and the emperor, heading the army, had failed to prepare in good time for
defence, so that, naturally, the whole empire had fallen into enemy hands.
Instead, he proposed his own plan: to train the soldiers and await a suitable
opportunity. Of course, they did not listen to him. The emperor Yan-xi threw
himself into the attack which completely failed, despite 50,000 Tatar horsemen
coming to support the Khitan. Dashi who, under the excuse of illness, had
refused to take part in the campaign made one more attempt to make the monarch
see reason, but was equally <b><font COLOR="#943634">{110} </font></b>unsuccessful
Judging by the fact that in the following year, 1125, the self-confident emperor
was captured by the Jurchen and the Liao Empire ceased to exist, one has to
think that Ye-lu Dashi had judged the circumstances correctly and this justifies
his subsequent actions, both historically and ethically.</p>
<p>Without waiting for the inevitable catastrophe, in the autumn
of 1124 Ye-lu Dashi killed two dignitaries who had pursued the ruinous policy of
unprepared and unprovided for counter-attacks, declared himself khan and in the
night fled to the west with only 200 faithful warriors in attendance Three days
later he crossed the &quot;Black River&quot;  <a name="sik2text140"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note140">[+140]</a>
and arrived among the Ongut who presented him with 400 horses, 20 camels and a
thousand sheep. This was the minimum required to cross the desert Each horseman,
apart from his war-horse, received one pack-horse and a remount. Military
equipment and fuel could be loaded on the camels, while in the steppe sheep were
a mobile stock of food Thanks to the Ongut help, Ye-lu Dashi crossed the Gobi in
three days of uninterrupted march and reached the fortress of Hotun on the
Orkhon, the extreme western point of the Khitan empire In view of its particular
importance, this fortress had a garrison of 20,000 unquestionably obedient to
Ye-lu Dashi And what were they to do? Ye-lu Dashi was the only Khitan prince
with a plan and programme to save, not the power which it was impossible to
save, but the life and freedom of the surviving Khitan None of them wished to
perish .With the fortress and the garrison, Ye-lu Dashi obtained the state herds
and, thanks to this, &quot;carried the war into open space&quot;, this saved
him.</p>
<p>What was the content of the new programme? First of all, a
change of title Ambagan, the founder of the empire, began as khan of the Khitan,
then, from 916 to 947, he and his son Deguang were emperors of the Khitan and
from 947 Wuyun became the Emperor of Liao  <a name="sik2text141"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note141">[+141]</a>.
This meant that the country was converted from a nomad power into a Chinese
state and as such perished in 1125, as had all its predecessors Ye-lu Dashi took
the title &quot;gurkhan&quot;, i.e. he broke with the Sinophile past  <a name="sik2text142"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note142">[+142]</a>.
His subjects became his comrades, his vassals became allies, his guard became a
retmue. And immediately there appeared the forces for war and victory, although
the situation seemed hopeless</p>
<p><b><font COLOR="#943634">{111}</font></b></p>
<h4>The Fate of the Khan</h4>
<p>In the twelfth century the word &quot;khan&quot; among the
nomads and hunters had quite a different sound than it now does to our ears
deafened by civilisation. In those days they distinguished splendidly between
the nuances in terminology relating to the nature of power. For example, the
title huang-di, which we translate very inexactly as &quot;emperor&quot;, was
associated for the nomads with foreign influence, Chinese in the east and Arab
in the west where the mediator between &quot;Heaven&quot; and man was the <i>caliph
</i>(deputy of the Prophet). The Mongols and Turks preferred to deal with
&quot;Heaven&quot; without such authorities.</p>
<p>The term &quot;king&quot; (in Chinese <i>wang</i>, in Persian
<i>Shah) </i>was linked with the principle of hereditary authority from father
to son, i.e. was a direct challenge to the steppe principle in which uncle was
considered superior to nephew. The king's authority, though lay, was regarded as
a form of violence to his subjects and thus did not find acceptance in the
steppe. On the other hand, the troops proclaimed a khan. This was not an
election in the sense of twentieth-century democracy; parliaments and corruption
would have found no place in the military headquarters and the surrounding
localities. Usually a descendant of khans became a khan, but he only took power
when the warriors raised him on the felt and expressed in cries their
willingness to obey him in war. In peacetime custom reigned; to this the khan
himself submitted, as did any herdsman wanting to keep his head on his
shoulders. So, in declaring himself khan, but not king or emperor, Ye-lu Dashi
straightaway lost a fair amount of power and acquired a large number of true
friends. But, then, the word &quot;khan&quot; means &quot;tribal leader&quot;,
and there were many tribes in the steppe.</p>
<p>Tribal fragmentation was the curse of the nomad world.
Quarrels over possession, cattle stealing, snatching women, blood vengeance, all
these continual troubles faded before a still more terrible consequence of
separatism: the inability of fragmented tribes to organise resistance to the
attacks of others. The so called alliances of tribes were an unstable and
ineffective form, particularly in war. Therefore, the demand for a strong
military authority became urgent as soon as a strong enemy appeared; such in the
twelfth century were the Jurchen.</p>
<p>In an analogous situation the seventh- to eighth-century
Turks <b><font COLOR="#943634">{112} </font></b>were able &quot;to make their
heads incline and their knees bend'  <a name="sik2text143"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note143">[+143]</a> for the
common good. This system was called <i>el </i>(<i>il</i>)<a name="sik2text144"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note144">[+144]</a>.
But the harshness of the system deprived it of popular appeal and condemned it
to perish, then it was replaced by a combination of tribal union, self-governing
in peacetime, with a strong authority intended to wage war. A gathering of
clansmen - a kuriltai - proclaimed the leader, called gurkhan, i.e. khan of a
confederation of tribes. Thanks to its legalised mutual restrictions, such a
situation suited both sides, the authorities and the subjects Ye-lu Dashi was
intelligent and educated enough to understand that he could retain the hope of
saving his land only by throwing the unexpended forces of the steppe dwellers
against the Jurchen bogged down in China It is true he also kept the title of
emperor just in case, but he did not have to use it since the Jurchen went from
victory to victory in his lifetime.</p>
<p>The Jurchen commander reporting to his emperor on Ye-lu Dashi
determined his forces at 10,000 horsemen The emperor ordered the attack to be
delayed, evidently because the main Jurchen forces were finishing off the Khitan
emperor Yan-xi in Northern China Thanks to this delay Ye-lu Dashi managed to
agree a joint counterattack with the Tangut on the Jurchen, intending to support
the Khitan emperor But the allies were too late the emperor Yan-xi was captured
and there was no one and nothing to save.</p>
<p>In 1126 Dashi's forces were increased, evidently from Khitan
fugitives who joined him in order not to become subject to the enemy. The
Chinese determined the number of his troops as already 100,000, in conventional
terms, taking account of the battle-worthiness of the Khitan veterans. In fact,
they were much fewer and, even given the alliance with the Tangut, were
insufficient to continue the war with the Jurchen Therefore, Dashi tried to
enter into negotiations with the Song Empire, promising he would forget Chinese
bad faith, if they would attack the Jurchen from the south. Then he undertook to
head an attack from the north-west.</p>
<p>But the Jurchen were not dozing In the winter of 1125-6 they
themselves undertook an offensive against the south Sixty thousand Jurchen
besieged the capital of China, Kaifeng, which more than 200,000 of the best
Chinese troops were flung into battle to save. Two parties formed in China
partisans of the war and <b><font COLOR="#943634">{113} </font></b>&quot;fighters
for peace&quot;. The latter prevailed and achieved the withdrawal of the Jurchen
by the payment of tribute and territorial concessions North China had been
terribly devastated, but this gave Ye-lu Dashi a breathing space, he succeeded
in making contact with the Tatars and inducing them not to sell horses to the
Jurchen Annoyed, the Jurchen arrested the heir of the Tatar leader, who had come
for negotiations, in order to put pressure on the Tatars. This action did not
increase Jurchen popularity in the steppe, but, in order to save their clan, the
Tatars agreed to act as guides for the Jurchen army sent against Ye-lu Dashi in
1128. This army was composed of Khitan subject to the conqueror and a prince of
the Ye-lu family was appointed to command it Ye-lu Dashi's isolation was
complete.</p>
<p>What could he do? He knew too well the staunchness and
courage of the Jurchen forces, the lack of principle and adventurism of his
Sinicized fellow-tribesmen, the unreliability of the Tangut and the egoism of
the Tatars. There were no hopes for success in battle or in the defence of the
fortress, and Dashi took the only correct solution he again marched west. The
Jurchen were unable to reach him and did not try. For them he had become safe
and uninteresting. It was much more advantageous to conquer China where the
demoralised ruling clique willingly sacrificed their people to ensure themselves
a joyful and placid life in the palaces and parks.</p>
<p>In January 1127 Kaifeng fell and the Chinese emperor was
taken prisoner, his brother transferred the capital to the south, leaving the
people of North China to be plundered by the enemy. The war party, who stood for
resistance to the conquerors, were isolated from both rulers and people. Their
leader, the famous commander, Yo Fei, had started his career with a crushing
defeat of a popular rising near Lake Dongtinghu (1130-5),  <a name="sik2text145"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note145">[+145]</a>
but then fell a victim to palace intrigues. The easiness of their victories and
the scent of wealth seduced the Jurchen, but brought with them the same results
as they had for the Khitan the Chinese culture of the intellect remained foreign
to them, but the culture of vice was completely assimilated This only benefited
the Mongols a hundred years later But let us return to our hero, since we have
now approached our subject in earnest.</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{114} </font></b>In 1129 Ye-lu Dashi led those Khitan
warriors who remained faithful to him out of the Ho tun fortress. He was
accompanied by about 40,000 horsemen, while in the previous year his troops had
numbered 100,000 - of course, both figures are conventional. Evidently, not all
the Khitan had agreed to leave their homeland and many preferred submission to
the enemy, rather than freedom in exile.</p>
<p>When he reached Bishbahk (in Southern Dzungaria), Dashi
counted his forces. The heads of seven sedentary regions of the Tianshan area
had joined him, evidently Uighur, and eighteen tribal leaders. The composition
of the latter is very noteworthy. Here were named: the great Yellow Shivei and
T'ele  <a name="sik2text146"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note146">[+146]</a> who dwelt along the Amur, as well as
their neighbours: the Ugi  <a name="sik2text147"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note147">[+147]</a> and
Bigude;<a name="sik2text148"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note148">[+148]</a>
then the Mongol tribes: Onggirat, Jajirat, Ilsut,<a name="sik2text149"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note149">[+149]</a>
Nirun,  <a name="sik2text150"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note150">[+150]</a> Targutai,  <a name="sik2text151"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note151">[+151]</a>
Tamgalik,  <a name="sik2text152"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note152">[+152]</a> Merkit, Khushin;  <a name="sik2text153"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note153">[+153]</a>
then the Zubu, already known to us &quot;probably a fragment of the horde which
had broken down thirty years before this&quot;, and Tangut, because Dashi had
not broken his alliance with the Xia kingdom. And, finally, four tribes about
which neither Wittfogel nor I can give any information: Pusuvyn`, Humus, Si-di
and Guy-er-bi.</p>
<p>Here is another example of our helplessness in the face of
the sources. It is extremely important to determine the tribal composition of
the Khitan king's allies, but the information which has lain in the scroll for
800 years is a puzzle not to be solved without the help of a special historical
analysis.</p>
<p>However vexing it may be, let us leave the four undisclosed
ethnonyms and see what those that have been identified give us.</p>
<p>The Tangut are clear; they were an auxiliary detachment of
the allied state of Xi-xia; the Zubu were Tatars who had surrendered <b><font COLOR="#943634">{115}
</font></b>and been included in the Khitan forces, but we note that the Tatars
voluntarily went over to the enemy side, i.e. the Jurchen.</p>
<p>Four tribes, the Yellow Shivei, T'ele, Bigude and Uriangqai,
were not nomads. Evidently, living side by side with the Jurchen, they had
struggled with them and were now compelled to save themselves from persecution,
since there was blood between the tribes. Much more important is that seven of
the tribal leaders were pure Mongols. We have to suppose that the traditional
enmity between them and the Tatars made them allies of the Khitan, but now, when
military success smiled on their enemies, those most compromised considered it
wise to leave their native steppes. But why did a Merkit detachment appear among
the Mongols? - that I cannot explain Probably, anyway, it is simply impossible
to explain everything, given the paucity of information. Yet we should note, all
the same, that it was not entire tribes, but some parts of them which followed
the indomitable leader, because the same tribes, at least in Mongolia, remained
in their places in the thirteenth century Hence, we may conclude that Ye-lu
Dashi did not have a levy of tribes, but a volunteer army and this explains its
high degree of military efficiency.</p>
<p>After occupying the fortress and town of Bishbalik, Dashi
gathered his commanders together and delivered a speech to them 1 le recognised
his people's defeat, the catastrophic disintegration of the Liao Empire, and
spoke of the last emperor's flight But such information did not correspond to
reality, since the emperor had I ought until he was captured Dashi, evidently,
preferred to keep these details from the leaders of the tribes that had been
collected. Then he declared his intention to move west and to rally the nomad
tribes of the Great Steppe to win back his native land In answer to his appeal
he obtained 10,000 warriors, well trained, armed and equipped  <a name="sik2text154"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note154">[+154]</a>.</p>
<p>But here, too, enemies were found as well as friends. A clash
with (he Kirghiz in the north showed that the way into Siberia was closed. An
attempt to attack Kashgar led to complete defeat and exacerbated relations with
the Muslim population of the Central Asian oases. The Khitan held on only in the
valley of the Imil and in the Seven Streams area where they took part in a
quarrel of the Kangyui and Karluk with the khan of the town of Balasagun Ye-lu
Dashi <b><font COLOR="#943634">{116}</font></b> deprived him of his authority as
khan, but left him in the post of &quot;ruling the Turks&quot;.</p>
<p>This success gave Ye-lu Dashi the firm point he needed. He
was not, of course, the first Khitan to arrive in Central Asia. The long and
unsuccessful war had thrown out of the Far East many people despairing of
victory and seeking a refuge with the Muslim princes of Mavarannahr. For
example, in 1128 the ruler of Samarkand had had about 16,000 Khitan tents and
used the emigrants as a defence for his eastern frontier. But as soon as Ye-lu
Dashi appeared in Balasagun, these and other Khitan flocked to him, thanks to
which his force doubled. The rich pastures of the Seven Streams area allowed the
Khitan to feed up their horses, and military success began to incline to their
side. At the end of 1129 Ye-lu Dashi conquered the Kangyui tribe and again
attacked Kashgar and Khotan. Both fortresses were taken.</p>
<p>The Jurchen army sent to follow the last unconquered Khitan
prince was powerless on entering the steppe. There, horses and guides were
needed, and the leaders of the nomad tribes refused obedience to the Jurchen. In
addition, the Mongols, then united by Qabul-khan, declared war on the Jurchen
and compelled them to return to Manchuria, and the Tangut replied to the Jurchen
Emperor that they did not know where Ye-lu Dashi was. The campaign of 1130 was
broken off.</p>
<p>In 1131 the Jurchen renewed their advance on Khotan, but lack
of provisions and the cold made them turn back. There was nothing for them to do
there anyway, since the commander they were pursuing was by then far to the
west, beyond the reach of the Jurchen Emperor. Those Khitan who had remained on
the Orkhon were, of course, captured. Apart from that, the Uighur from Hezhou
seized several Khitan and handed them directly to the Jurchen, thus depriving
the renegade commanding the punitive army of his last trophies.  <a name="sik2text155"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note155">[+155]</a>
After so many failures, he fell under suspicion of having dealings with the
enemy. The unfortunate man had no choice but to rise in revolt and to pay for
this with his life (1132).</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{117} </font></b>It seemed to Ye-lu Dashi that this was the
moment to realise his cherished dream: to free his homeland and its people.</p>
<p>In 1134 he sent 70,000 horsemen east through the desert to
restore the former glory of Liao. But the desert is a barrier for any army. The
Khitan troops lost so many horses and cattle on the road that they had to turn
back half-way. Ye-lu Dashi exclaimed: &quot;Heaven does not favour me! It is its
will.&quot;  <a name="sik2text156"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note156">[+156]</a> This ended the war in the east,
only for it to burst forth with fresh force on the western border of the Great
Steppe.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Appearance of a Priest-King</h4>
<p>Before continuing with the further exposition of the course
of events, it is convenient to halt and pose several puzzling questions. As we
observed above, Ye-lu Dashi brought about 10,000 horsemen to Dzungaria and
doubled this number from Khitan who had fled to the west before him. So, he had
about 20,000, perhaps even 30,000, warriors. By the conquest of Kashgar and
Khotan he immediately raised the whole Muslim world against him; and by the
subordination of the Kangyui, the Great Kipchak steppe as well. In other words,
the situation on the western border of the Kara-Kitai (as it now came to be
called) khanate was extremely tense, the more so as, behind the petty Muslim
princes, stood the Seljuk Sanjar commanding the strongest army of those
operating in the Near East. The question arises, from where could the gurkhan
allocate 70,000 warriors for the eastern campaign? This was three times greater
than his total forces, even if he completely denuded the western borderland of
his domain! Evidently, from 1130 to 1135 Ye-lu Dashi's forces grew to some
enormous figure, but from what and from whom?</p>
<p>Let us turn to the sources.21 The Chinese are simply silent.
Ibn al-Asir informs us that in 1130 the Karluk and Guz hirelings quarrelled with
the ruler of Samarkand, Arslan-khan, and, as the sultan Sanjar supported the
latter, they fled to the gurkhan. But this refers to a lew thousand, not
hundreds of thousands. Juvaini tells us that in 1131 the gurkhan made raids on
Ferghana and Mavarannahr and conquered both regions. This is not confirmed as
regards <b><font COLOR="#943634">{118} </font></b>Mavarannahr, for Samarkand was
not taken, and even Hodjent remained in Muslim hands. Evidently, these were
simply raids, not changing the disposition of forces, but exacerbating the
situation.</p>
<p>There is then a six year silence. No events! It is
understandable why the Muslim behaved so passively. They simply paid no
attention to a very small principality of &quot;faithless Turks&quot; which had
newly arisen. But during this period Ye-lu Dashi was able to prepare so that at
Hodjent in 1137 he completely smashes the forces of Rukn ad-din Mahmud-khan who
had replaced the luckless intriguer, Arslan-khan, exiled by sultan Sanjar in
1130, as ruler of Samarkand.</p>
<p>This time the Muslim were disturbed. &quot;Great terror and
grief came upon them.&quot; However, no events took place for four whole years.
For some reason, Ye-lu Dashi made no use of the fruits of his victory. Mahmud of
Samarkand was distracted by his struggle with his own troops from the Karluk
tribe who appealed to the gurkhan for support. Only in 1141 did a new conflict
arise, and this time on an immense scale. The sultan Sanjar appeared for a
struggle with the infidel and was accompanied by auxiliary detachments from
Khorasan, Sejestan and the mountain regions of Gur, Gazna, Mazanderan. Here were
the best troops of the Muslim world, hardened in battles with the Greeks and the
crusaders, equipped to the limit with the technology then available. Sanjar's
force numbered approximately 100,000 horsemen. The Muslim had not fielded such
forces even against the crusaders.</p>
<p>Despite the fragmentary data of the sources, it is clear that
the sultan and his suite regarded the operation that had been initiated
extremely seriously, and not simply as repelling the next of the nomad raids
continually being made for plunder. What could so put them on their guard?</p>
<p>And what of Ye-lu Dashi himself? According to the words of
Ibn al-Asir he allegedly fielded 300,000 warriors &quot;from the Khitan, Turks
and Chinese&quot;.  <a name="sik2text157"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note157">[+157]</a> What can this phrase mean?
There were less than 30,000 Khitan horsemen. The greater part of the Turks lived
to the north and west of Balkhash, i.e. beyond the limits of the Kara-Kitai
power. There could not be any Chinese. The eastern nomadic Mongols at this time
were engaged in active war with the Jurchen, as were the Tangut. Briefly, there
was nowhere for support to come <b><font COLOR="#943634">{119} </font></b>from
for the war with the Muslim, and there was no reason for the eastern steppe
dwellers to support a khan who had fled from them.</p>
<p>Yet, despite all this, in 1141 in the Katwan valley, between
Hodjent and Samarkand, Ye-lu Dashi, after dividing his force into three parts,
pressed the Muslims back into the valley of the Dirgam (a tributary of the
Zeravshan) and routed them as neither Charles Martel, nor Leo the Isaurian, nor
Gottfried of Bouillon had been able to do. Sultan Sanjar managed to flee, but
his wife and companions were captured, and 30,000 of the best Seljuk warriors
suffered the death of the brave. That is a fact! What he did is undoubted, but
why this could happen is incomprehensible and no one has explained it. So, we
have to seek an explanation. And, what is more, after such a brilliant victory,
Ye-lu Dashi limited himself to occupying Samarkand and Bukhara, and some Khitan
detachment plundered the Khwarizm oasis. The Khwarizmshah, incidentally, quickly
came to an agreement with the gurkhan, undertaking to pay certain dues in kind
and 30,000 gold dinars a year. The local rulers were kept in all the Central
Asian towns seized by the Khitan; they were merely obliged to pay the gurkhan a
small due. How are we to explain such strange moderation? The gurkhan should
surely at least have rewarded his troops, but he had no means of his own. Here,
too, the sources are silent.</p>
<p>What if we pose the question another way, based on our
knowledge of the situation and from a commonsense point of view? Let us start
with what is known: money and men are needed for war. Ye-lu Dashi had no money,
since all the wealth of the Liao Empire fell into the hands of the conqueror.
But there were many people in the twelfth-century steppe, and far from all of
them were closely linked with their tribes. Two factors played a key part here:
(1) the increased moisture  <a name="sik2text158"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note158">[+158]</a> of the steppe which
stimulated not only the extension of pastures and an increase in the herds, but
also a population increase since there was something with which to feed the
children, and they grew up into warriors; (2) the nomad life in which each tribe
has a strictly determined region for its movements and thus enters into its
biocenosis. Each family had a section with a specific quantity of grass and
water and, consequently, of cattle and horses. S.I. Rudenko has shown that, to
ensure minimum needs for <b><font COLOR="#943634">{120} </font></b>the average
herding family of five persons, twenty-five horses were essential. This is based
on the following data: one adult horse is the equivalent of five to six cattle,
six sheep or goats; a two-year old is equated with half a horse, a yearling with
a quarter. To this we need to add transport animals: four to six pack-horses per
tent, and ten to twelve horses for a rich yurt and its contents.  <a name="sik2text159"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note159">[+159]</a>
Consequently, for a nomad economy to grow rich on its plot it was essential not
only to increase the amount of fodder, but to stabilise the population; its
growth would swallow all the benefits nature might give the nomad. In drought
conditions, when infant mortality was high, there were few excess people in the
steppe; now they had appeared and the elders of the herding tribes were glad to
rid themselves of them. If the gurkhan accepts people, let them go to him and
not return.</p>
<p>Thus, if tribes could not be mobilised, it was possible to
collect people who were too energetic, too troublesome in their native nomadic
grounds and trained enough for war service. There was one complication: it was
difficult to rely on these semi-hirelings. Their leaders might be particularly
dangerous. Therefore, Ye-lu Dashi introduced a system in which no single
commander could have more than 100 horsemen and all the officers in charge of a
100 were directly subordinate to the gurkhan.</p>
<p>The volunteers who had been gathered together had to be fed,
armed, trained, and that meant that someone had to give the money which the
gurkhan did not have. Let us see, who could this be? He who had it and needed
the gurkhan to fight the Muslim. Only the merchants taking caravans from China
to Europe and back had ready money in the thirteenth century. Muslim merchants,
naturally, are excluded; Jewish trade had been interrupted in 965 with the
destruction of Itil`, the important trans-shipment point. There remain the
Uighurs, one part of whom were Buddhists, the other Nestorians.</p>
<p>In Uighuria Buddhism flourished in accordance with canons
forbidding monks to touch gold, silver and women. Consequently, true Buddhists
had no connection with trade, though their monasteries were fairly rich. On the
contrary, the Nestorians traded everywhere and hated the Muslim with all the
passion they were capable of. And <b><font COLOR="#943634">{121} </font></b>here
we shall return from ideas to facts. It was the Uighurs who accepted the fleeing
gurkhan in their capital Bishbalik, supplied him with provisions, gave him the
chance to reorganise his army and, afterwards, to replenish it with lively
fellows from the steppes. For this they obtained what any businessman needs:
their protege smashed their competitors in Samarkand, Ferghana, Kashgar, and
Khotan and ensured them the monopoly of the caravan trade. The flowering of the
Uighur merchant towns began from the battle of Katwan, and where power fell into
the hands of the Christians the Muslim merchants were liable to tax.  <a name="sik2text160"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note160">[+160]</a></p>
<p>But we would be committing the grossest &quot;modernisation&quot;
were we to forget the confessional factor. Although Christianity was permitted
in the Seljuk sultanate, the Muslim, of course, had every possible advantage.
Next, the Nestorians themselves were noted for their intolerance but, though not
sparing the means for war against those of another faith, they lacked a suitable
military leader. Ye-lu Dashi met all their demands: he was sufficiently
cultivated to avoid suspicion of paganism, sufficiently worldly not to become a
Buddhist monk and, as an enemy of sultan Sanjar, he could not even dream of
accepting Islam. He was, evidently, not baptised, since even in 1130 he made the
traditional Khitan sacrifice to Heaven, Earth and his ancestors - a grey bull
and a white horse. But he did this rather for his warriors, although the
Confucian education he had received in his youth was no obstacle to retaining
such survivals in his consciousness. The basic point was that, as an experienced
politician, he understood that if he wanted to remain in the new land he should
ensure himself of the support of at least a part of the local population, though
they were Nestorians. Therefore, despite his letter to the ruler of Bukhara
which starts with the formula acceptable to the Muslim: &quot;In the name of God
the Compassionate, the Merciful&quot;,  <a name="sik2text161"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note161">[+161]</a> his
heir received the Christian name of Elijah (I-lieh), and the crusaders in
Palestine and Syria sincerely believed in the existence of a Christian kingdom
east of Persia.</p>
<p>In fact, it did not exist, but the idea of its existence, of
its necessity and even of the possibility of its being realised arose and played
a part in the political and military history of Asia. The Christian kingdom
headed by a priest-king is merely a dream of the eastern <b><font COLOR="#943634">{122}
</font></b>Christians, but this dream was so effective that by the time of Ye-lu
Dashi's death it had begun to seem a reality to many and, for the sake of this
dream, former enemies, the Nestorians and the Jacobites (monophysites), were
reconciled The unification of these two churches, with complete disregard for
dogma, took place in 1142, when Ye-lu Dashi was still alive  <a name="sik2text162"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note162">[+162]</a></p>
<p></p>
<h4>John's Kingdom</h4>
<p>Ye-lu Dashi died in 1143. His son Elijah was still a minor
and power passed into the hands of his mother, the khansha, whom the gurkhan had
appointed regent before his death. Yet even after his death the nomads of
Mongolia, as well as both. Far Eastern empires, the Jurchen Kin and the Chinese
Song, regarded his successors as Dashi himself and ascribed the actions of the
Kara-Khitan rulers to him.</p>
<p>Over the previous ten years the Km (Jurchen Jin) Empire had
come to terms with its conquest by the Khitan and decided to establish relations
with those who had fled to the west. However, as soon as, in 1144, the Jurchen
emissary appeared before the gurkhan, who was engaged in hunting, and demanded
that he should descend from his horse and hear the Imperial Rescript, he was
dragged from his saddle and killed.</p>
<p>In 1151 Elijah ascended the throne and ruled peacefully until
1161 In this period there took place only one conflict between the Khitan and
Khwarizm, even that ended without bloodshed because the Khitan did not engage in
battle with the overwhelming forces of Khwarizm (1158). On Elijah's death, his
younger sister ascended the throne and ruled until 1177 She perished as a result
of a romantic story her lover persuaded the khansha to kill her husband. The
father of the murdered man raised the troops and the khansha and her lover were
seized and killed In 1178. Elijah's son, Julkhu (Jurka, i.e. Yurka, Yurn,
George) came to the throne and ruled till 1213. In the first part of his reign
he was engaged in retaining the position won by his grandfather in Central Asia,
to achieve this he helped the Patriarch Elijah III found a Nestorian
metropolitan see of Kashgar and Nevaket (Seven Streams)  <a name="sik2text163"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note163">[+163]</a>
In the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{123} </font></b>second part, he was obliged to
become engaged in politics linked with the wars of Chinggiskhan, but that will
be dealt with in a separate chapter devoted not to the creation, but to the
destruction of the Kara-Khitan power.</p>
<p>The territory seized and acquired by the founder of the Kara-Khitan
power embraced, at the time of his death, three large areas. Western Dzungaria
from the river Imil in the north and the Seven Streams area as far as the Chu in
the south  <a name="sik2text164"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note164">[+164]</a> was under the direct control of the
gurkhan. This territory was extremely convenient for nomads and semi-nomads;
thanks to the variety of mountain and steppe pastures, it fed 84,500 tents
(family units), including the local Turkish population. The army was
correspondingly small: 10,000 at the direct disposal of the gurkhan and
30,000-50,000 with a full mobilisation.  <a name="sik2text165"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note165">[+165]</a></p>
<p>The capital, or rather the headquarters, Balasagun, lay in
the upper reaches of the Chu, not far from Issyk-Kul. Another town, Imil was not
far from the eastern extremity of Balkhash. This small, picturesque, poor region
was the celebrated &quot;Kingdom of Prester John&quot;.
 <a name="sik2text166"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note166">[+166]</a></p>
<p>South of the Chu and the Central Tianshan lay a much larger
territory subject to the gurkhan through conquest. In the south it was bounded
by the waves of the Amudarya, on the west by the Aral Sea, since the
Khwarizmshahs recognised the superior authority of the gurkhan, on the east by
the rich oasis of Khotan. Kashgar, Samarkand, Bukhara and Termez, having their
own rulers like Khwarizm and Khotan, saw fit, after the battle of Katwan, to pay
the gurkhan a tribute that was not burdensome and guaranteed them peace and
freed them from the need to organise a costly defence of their northern
frontier. The Uighur Idykut was also numbered among the gurkhan's vassals, but
this, evidently, was more like symbiosis than a real subordination. The Uighurs
behaved very independently in relation to the Khitan.</p>
<p>Now we have outlined the true frontiers of the Kingdom of
Pope John it will be very useful to glance at the Russian text of the &quot;Tale
of the Indian Kingdom&quot; which we have not so far used. Unlike the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{124}
</font></b>Latin description quoted above, here we have some interesting details
on which we shall focus our attention.</p>
<p>To start with, the text is a sort of medieval &quot;science
fiction&quot; Here are three-legged people, three-fathom giants and
half-bird-half-horses, crocodiles and the phoenix, but what is interesting is
that there is geographic information.</p>
<p>In the midst of the kingdom lies &quot;a lake of sand and it
stays nowhere in one place, the mound goes whence the wind drags it, and mounds
arise on the shore for 200 miles.&quot; This is a quite exact description of
sandy desert with dunes, the only point not clear is which desert the author had
in mind, the Takla-Makan or that of Central Dzungaria. So let us look further at
the text &quot;To the side of that sea 3 days [journey - LG] are high hills and
from them a stony river flows, it bears great and small stones along for 3 days.
That stone comes into our land, into that sandy sea, and the mounds cover that
sea, and near that river, one day's journey away, are deserted high hills, a man
cannot see their summits, and from that point the river, now small, flows
underground.&quot;</p>
<p>This is a description of the southern slopes of the Tianshan
where there are constant falls of stone and scree which cover the river beds and
where the streams surface only on the edge of the sandy desert It was here that
was located a string of rich oases in Uighuria Kucha, Kurlya, Aksu etc. Later
there are mentions of the precious stones found in the bed of these rivers, here
it is worth recalling that Khotan is a source of jade and jasper, and in the
neighbouring mountains are sources of rubies, sapphires and laips lazuli.
Finally, the mention that the streams fall into a large river where there are
many fish and that these are eaten raw is important. The large river is the
Tarim. Thus, amidst fantastic inventions an exceedingly valuable detail is found
- the pontiff's kingdom is located in Uighuria.</p>
<p>At first glance this also contradicts historical reality,
since the gurkhan's headquarters and his warriors&quot; grazing grounds were
north of the Tianshan, but literalism, as we mentioned above, most often leads
to confusion. The author of the &quot;Tale of the Indian Kingdom&quot; was least
of all interested in reality. The image and the sense was important to him.
Therefore, he painted a picture of a country which was the heart of eastern
Nestorianism, a picture which inspired the take-off of an east Christian culture
opposed to both Buddhism and to Islam In this sense he confirms our guess that
it was the Uighur who were the initiators of the Crusade of the Yellow <b><font COLOR="#943634">{125}
</font></b>Cross, the blow from which the Seljuk sultanate was unable to
recover.</p>
<p>From this point of view the author of our source was correct
and probably his contemporaries understood him, but we, accustomed to business
language and statistical exacitude, are simply unable to understand the system
of images and associations and to find behind the metaphors the true content
which was evident to the medieval reader. It means that the problem in
translation does not lie in a simple substitution of words and phrases, but to a
greater extent in explaining the sense and the manner of exposition.</p>
<p>Yes, but that is not all! Historical reality was displaced by
vividness of purport, but not entirely. We shall be convinced of this if we look
at the question of the northern border of the Kara-Khitan khanate.</p>
<p>Unlike the southern and western borders, the northern limits
of the Kara-Khitan kingdom cannot be determined with sufficient certainty. It is
generally considered that this frontier passed along the river Imil, but to the
north, in the Irtysh basin, the powerful tribe of the Naiman lived; their origin
and ethnic allegiance still remains an open question.<a name="sik2text167"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note167">[+167]</a>&nbsp;
The history of the Naiman is authentically known only from the period of
Chinggiskhan, i.e. from the second half of the twelfth century.<a name="sik2text168"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note168">[+168]</a>
That is where the solution lies. While the majority of nomad tribes in steppe
Asia are known to historians from the end of the tenth or start of the eleventh
centuries, information on the Naiman, a very large, strong and cultivated
people, in fact appears at the end of the twelfth century.</p>
<p>There is no people or culture without history; consequently,
the ancestors of the Naiman were members of some other ethnic group, and we may
even definitely assert that they were simply Khitan.</p>
<p>In Middle Asia each people had, apart from its ethnic name, a
synonym, the number of tribes constituting it. Thus, the Uighurs were called
Tokuz-Oguz, i.e. nine tribes; the Karluk, Uc-Oguz or three tribes; the Basmil,
forty tribes; the Tangut, seven tribes. The Khitan were an eight-tribe people,
and the word naima means eight in Mongolian. Only proper names and
&quot;cultural words&quot; have <b><font COLOR="#943634">{126} </font></b>survived
of the Naiman language. Both of these are usually borrowings from their
neighbours. Yet we know that, in clashing with the Kerait and the Mongols, the
Naiman explained themselves splendidly to them, and this tells us they were
Mongol-speaking. But from where could Mongol-speaking nomads arrive in the Altai
in the second half of the twelfth century? Only along with the Khitan, or rather
as part of the Khitan, comrades of Ye-lu Dashi. Such is the probability, but the
time has come to turn again to the sources.</p>
<p>Rashid ad-Din tells us: &quot;Before the period of
Chinggiskhan Narkysh-Tayang and Eniat-kaan were lords of the Naiman... they
routed the tribe of the Kirghiz... Buyiruq and Tayang [contemporaries of
Chinggiskhan - LG] were the sons of Eniat-kaan [later he is called
Inancha-bilge-qan - LG]... the tribes of the Naiman were nomads, some dwelt in
mountainous places, others in valleys... they had a large and effective army;
their customs and habits were similar to those of the Mongols&quot;.  <a name="sik2text169"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note169">[+169]</a>
</p>
<p>Let us add the words of the Minorite friar, William of
Rubruck, to the Muslim author's information: &quot;It was at this time, when the
Franks took Antioch [in June 1098], that rule in the northern lands belonged to
a single person named Kon-kham [two words have been confused: khan and kam, i.e.
soothsayer - LG]. This Kon was a Karakatai. [In 1098 there was not yet a
division into Katai or Khitan and Kara-Kitai. The thirteenth-century author is
&quot;modernising&quot;.] These Katai [Kara-Khitan] lived in certain hills
through which I passed [he went by one of three passes between the western and
internal parts of Middle Asia, between the Altai and the Tian-shan],  <a name="sik2text170"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note170">[+170]</a>
and in a valley between these mountains lived a certain Nestorian pastor, a
powerful man, holding sway over the people called Naiman and belonging to the
Nestorian Christians [Western Dzungaria, the region of the Kara-Khitan gurkhan
Ye-lu Dashi is described - LG]. On the death of Kon-kham [the Emperor of the
Liao dynasty - LG] this Nestorian proclaimed himself a king and the Nestorians
called him King John, saying ten times more about him than was consonant with
the truth. That is how the Nestorians behave who arrive from those countries:
they create'great speeches from nothing.&quot;  <a name="sik2text171"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note171">[+171]</a>
</p>
<b><font COLOR="#943634">
<p>{127} </font></b>The chronology here is considerably
confused, and deliberately so. The date of the capture of Antioch coincides with
the rout and conquest of the Zubu by the Khitan and the unification of the
eastern part of the Great Steppe by the Liao Empire. This event could not but
remain in the minds of the nomads from whom Rubruck had the information a
century and a half later.</p>
<p>Now let us compare the texts. Despite apparent contradictions
they supplement one another. Rubruck certainly describes Ye-lu Dashi and the
territory of his khanate, calling it Naiman. Rashid ad-Din notes that, prior to
the end of the thirteenth century, the Naiman had only one lord, Eniat or
Inancha [Johann, Ivan], a name either easily recast as John, or simply the name
John converted into Eniat.</p>
<p>Then the date, the war with the Kirghiz. As we already know,
the Khitan clashed with the Kirghiz in 1129. The Kirghiz were able to repulse
them, but the steppes of Western Mongolia lying south of the Sayan range,
naturally, fell to the Khitan. Only from here, using the reserves of people from
these bountiful steppes, was Ye-lu Dashi able to gather warriors to rout the
Seljuk sultan in 1141, after which he was known as the king-presbyter. But after
his death in 1143 the borderlands began to fall away and Eniat, with the Turkish
name of Inancha, Bilge Buku-qan (wise and strong man),&nbsp; <a name="sik2text172"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note172">[+172]</a>
at the head of his detachment on the territory protected by the Mongolian Altai,
became independent and transferred power to his two sons whose names have
remained unknown. Their titles are enough for us, though: the elder was called
Tayang-qan, and the younger Buyiruq-qan. By using Turkish titles the Naiman
preserved Mongol speech.  <a name="sik2text173"></a><a href="sik2c.htm#sik2note173">[+173]</a></p>
<p>Thus, at first the northern boundary of the khanate which in
Europe was called the Kingdom of Prester John reached the Sayan range, but weak,
feminine hands lost control of the northern lands, most likely during the
disturbed times of 1177, and the frontiers of the state contracted so much that
they ceased to be viable. It turns out that the inventions of the European
scandalmongers were far from the truth, but let us await the conclusion. In the
