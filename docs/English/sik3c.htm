<h3><a name="sik3para09">9. Dealing with the
Conquerors (1259-1312)</a></h3>
<h4>The Yellow Crusade</h4>
<p>The next kuriltai of the Mongol people and troops took place
on the green banks of the meandering upper reaches of the Onon in 1253 It was
decided to complete the war in China, for which prince Kubilai was appointed,
and to free Jerusalem from the Muslims, and this was entrusted to prince Hulegu</p>
<p>The selection of candidates for these most responsible
operations seems surprising Kubilai's Christian sympathies were a secret to no
one,  <a name="sik3text104"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note104">[+104]</a> but he was
sent to a country where dominance over men's minds was divided between
Confucians, Taoists and Buddhists Hulegu was an open worshipper of Maitreya,  <a name="sik3text105"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note105">[+105]</a>
a mystical trend in Buddhism which was particularly patronised by the Mongol
khans,  <a name="sik3text106"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note106">[+106]</a> and he
was ordered to defend the Christian faith! One can imagine that Mongke, a
skilful and intelligent politician, did not make these appointments by chance
The phantom of secession by the borderlands had already begun to alarm the
expanding Mongol Empire and it was extremely important that contact between a
regent and his subjects should not be entirely complete A khan of another faith
must always seek support from the central authority and this hindered his
secession very much indeed Therefore, Kubilai received Kipchak and Alan troops
to conquer the south Chinese empire,  <a name="sik3text107"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note107">[+107]</a>
and Hulegu was accompanied by a retinue of Buddhist monks, Uighurs, Tibetans and
Chinese,  <a name="sik3text108"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note108">[+108]</a> linked
with their native lands and their sovereign, the great khan Mongke.</p>
<p>On the other hand, however, measures were taken to forestall
a <b><font COLOR="#943634">{195} </font></b>possible
defeat of the army as a result of lack of contact with the local population.
Hulegu-khan's wife, the Kerait Dokuz-Qatun, was a Christian and a protectress of
the Christians. The chief of staff, the Naiman Kit-Buka-noyan, was a fervent
Nestorian and he chose his assistants from his co-religionists. Finally, Hetoum
I, the king of Armenia Minor, who had personally been to Mongke's headquarters
in 1253 and asked the khan to review seven articles of their treaty, allied
himself to the Mongols. These articles are so curious that it is worthwhile to
adduce them, though in brief. The king asked the khan (1) to be baptised with
all his people; (2) to establish friendship between Christians and Tatars; (3)
to free the clergy from taxes; (4) to return the Holy Land to the Christians;
(5) to have done with the Caliph of Baghdad; (6) that, at the king's request,
all the Tatar military commanders should without delay offer him help; (7) to
return the lands formerly taken from the Armenians by the Muslims. Evidently the
khan was weighing up the difficulties of the enterprise he had ventured on,
because he agreed to the Armenian king's conditions and thus ensured himself of
his active support.  <a name="sik3text109"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note109">[+109]</a>
Moreover, Hetoum brought the Antioch prince Boemund, whom he had bound to
himself by giving him his daughter in marriage, into the alliance with the
Mongols.</p>
<p>The preparation of the military expedition was carried out
exceedingly carefully. In order to preserve the pastures untouched, the nomad
population was driven off from the army's route, pontoon bridges were
constructed across rivers, provisions were prepared and a thousand specialists
in machines for projectiles were summoned from China.
 <a name="sik3text110"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note110">[+110]</a> The army moved without haste and only crossed to the
left bank of the Amu Darya in January 1256. Then, at the end of 1257 it
liquidated all the Ismaili fortresses in Iran and occupied Baghdad in February
1258.</p>
<p>The fall of Baghdad was taken by the eastern Christians as
heavenly retribution on the oppressors for a century of humiliation and
arbitrary rule. Dokuz-hatun's intercession was enough for Hulegu to forbid the
killing and plundering of Christians of all creeds. The khan even gave the
Nestorian Patriarch the Caliph's palace as his residence. This won for him the
hearts of the Armenians and Syrians who, in the words of the Armenian historian <b><font COLOR="#943634">{196}
</font></b>Kirakos, had languished under the Muslim yoke for 647
years. <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik3text111"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note111">[+111]</a></font> The
Armenian Patriarch blessed the khan in his holy war and the king of Armenia
Minor (Cilicia), Hetoum I, and his son-in-law the prince of Antioch, Boemund VI,
united their forces with those of the Mongols. The road to Syria was open to the
Mongols.</p>
<p>The Ayyubid sultans in Mesopotamia and Syria, despite their
undoubted prowess, fell victims to the Mongol and Christian alliance. The
descendants of the valorous Yusuf Sala ad-Din, who had taken Jerusalem from the
Crusaders in 1187 and repulsed Richard the Lionheart in 1192, plundered the
Kurds, but lacked the abilities of the founder of the dynasty and spent their
time in internecine wars, even making alliances with the Crusaders against their
co-religionists and relatives. Greater bitterness than ever was shown in this
war, because the Mongols began to practise torture in executing prisoners,
something that had not hitherto taken place. It looks as if they borrowed
certain little-esteemed usages from their Near Eastern allies. The mosques in
Aleppo, Damascus, Hama, Homs, Baniyas were burnt and the Christian churches
decorated with trophies. The spring of 1259 found the Mongol force near Gaza. It
seemed that the days of Islam's dominance were numbered.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>New Enemies of the Christians</h4>
<p>The last refuge of fervent Muslims in 1259 was Egypt where
Sala ad-Din's descendants were considered the legal rulers, but, in fact, they
had not been such for many years. Egypt was a rich country, but it was worse
than useless to mobilise the fellahin or the Arab traders of the Cairo bazaar
for war service. They paid their taxes to the sultan's treasury, but did not
know how to fight and did not want to. Therefore, the Ayyubids bought prisoners
of war in the Sudan and Crimea, taught them the art of war and used them for
military service. As these slaves belonged to the state they were called Mamluks
(state slaves).</p>
<p>The economic and social position of the Mamluks was
incomparably higher than that of the free tax payers. They were organised and
coherent and were the only real power in the land. They had conquered the
enemies of Islam, the Crusaders, and it had been <b><font COLOR="#943634">{197}
</font></b>they who made Louis IX throw himself on the mercy of
the conqueror. But when it seemed to them that they were being badly led they
took power into their own hands.</p>
<p>On 2 May 1250 the Mamluk Baybars stirred up his comrades and,
taking the palace of the sultan Turan-shah, killed this stupid child. The
Mamluks put a child on the throne, Kamil, on whose behalf the sultana Shejeret
ad-durr ruled with the Turkmen Mamluk, Aibek, who became her husband. In 1257
the jealous sultansha poisoned her husband for infidelity, but the Mamluks put
her in prison, and in 1259 another Mamluk, Kuttuz, ordered that allegiance be
sworn to himself.  <a name="sik3text112"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note112">[+112]</a>
This evoked not the least murmur, because it was clear to everyone in Egypt that
only the Mamluks could save the country from the Mongols.</p>
<p>The Mamluks had personal accounts to settle with the Mongols.
They had all in their time been taken prisoner by the Mongols and sold in the
slave bazaars. They perceived their purchase almost as liberation, and this was
quite right. In Egypt they encountered their fellow countrymen, Kipchaks,
Cherkes, Turkmen who had only been sold earlier and had managed to set
themselves up. These supported the new arrivals and together they cursed the
Mongols who had deprived them of their homeland and freedom. Now, in 1259, the
Mongols again threatened them ... and the Mamluks knew with what. Again to stand
naked and fettered in the slave bazaar, to wait until you are bought and sent to
dig irrigation ditches in the burning sun - this, perhaps, was worse than death
in battle. Therefore, the Mamluks decided to fight to the last drop of blood,
and they knew how to fight no worse than the Mongols themselves. They, too, were
steppe dwellers like those who were attacking them, and the Kipchak Kuttuz and
Baybars did not cede to the Naiman Kit-Buka in military talent.</p>
<p>The Mamluks had certain advantages in the impending
encounter. As the base for their offensive, the wealth of Egypt was closer to
Palestine than Iraq ruined by the war. The Mongol troops were tired from their
campaign, while the Mamluks carefully prepared men and horses. The Syrian
Muslims awaited the sultan Kuttuz as eagerly as a year before the Christians had
awaited khan Hulegu. Finally, the Mamluks had an unexpected ally, while the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{198}
</font></b>Mongols had two unenvisaged enimies. Thus, the balance
of victory began to shift.</p>
<p>The Kingdom of Jerusalem lay on the right flank of the
advancing Mongol army, it had lost the holy city, but retained the whole coastal
belt with strong fortresses Tyre, Sidon and Acre Real power here lay with the
Templars and Order of St. John, and control of the sea with the Venetians and
Genoese. While the whole of Western Europe was rejoicing at the victories of the
eastern Christians and comparing Hulegu and Dokuz-hatun with Constantine and
Helena, the Crusader knights and monks declared that &quot;if the Mongol devils
come, they will find Christ's servants on the field ready for battle&quot;,  <a name="sik3text113"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note113">[+113]</a>
and the Papal Legate excommunicated Boemund from the church for his alliance
with the Mongols.  <a name="sik3text114"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note114">[+114]</a></p>
<p>This was an open betrayal of the matter they had promised to
pursue. But still more surprising, 600 years later a German historian justified
the Crusaders&quot; treachery, claiming that &quot;it was clear to the knights
that to struggle with the Turks with such barbarian allies was as much to drive
out the devil by the power of Beelzebub&quot;.  <a name="sik3text115"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note115">[+115]</a>
He does not even trouble to explain to himself why the steppe
&quot;barbarians&quot; converted to Islam are dearer to him than the steppe
dwellers who for two hundred years had professed the Christian faith! No, it is
easier to understand the greed of the Venetians and the treachery of the
Templars than the arrogance of the civilised. European for whom everything east
of the Vistula is savagery and mediocrity. Yet it was this conception, accepted
without proof, that satisfied the most active section of the medieval knights
and merchants from the thirteenth century onwards. This was a serious
misconception, but it played a decisive part in the events which took place in
the second half of the thirteenth century.</p>
<p>The second unforeseen complication arose in Georgia. Until
1256 this country counted as an ulus of the Golden Horde, but on Batu's death it
passed within the competence of the Ilkhan Hulegu. The population of Georgia had
grown to 5 million,  <a name="sik3text116"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note116">[+116]</a>
i.e. it almost equalled the population of Rus` at that time. The wounds
inflicted by the Muslim Turks of Jalal ad-Din had been forgotten.</p>
<p>The Mongols considered the Georgians their natural allies and
so <b><font COLOR="#943634">{199} </font></b>did
not deprive them of self-government. Two Georgian kings called David (David
Narin and Ulu David - Little and Big) sat simultaneously in Tbilisi, and Ulu
David was married to a Mongol princess. Georgia was only liable to pay taxes
(the Mongols themselves also paid a poll tax) and to participate in war with the
Muslim, the age-old enemies of Georgia. Then, in 1259 the Georgians rebelled!</p>
<p>They did this without any due consideration. At first David
Narin rebelled but, not having any success, he sacrificed his country to the
enemy and took off to the mountain castles of Imeretia. Then Ulu David rebelled,
was defeated and also fled, leaving his people to be punished. In 1262 he
returned and begged forgiveness, and thus restored his original situation. The
royal foolhardiness cost Georgia much blood and it was tragic for the Christian
cause since the Mongols, instead of relying on the Georgian troops, expended
their reserves on slaughtering them at the very moment when each man was
precious in Palestine. Only the warlike Mamluks gained from this concatenation
of circumstances.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Kit-Buka-noyan</h4>
<p>In the autumn of 1259, in the heat of the Syrian campaign,
Hulegu-khan was informed of the death of his brother, the supreme khan Mongke.
In the Mongol Empire an interregnum always led to a halt in all affairs and
demanded the personal presence of the Chinggisids at a kuriltai. Apart from
that, Hulegu did not get on with Berke, a Muslim and enemy of the Nestorian
church. Therefore, the Ilkhan hurriedly returned to Iran leaving only 20,000
troops in Palestine commanded by Kit-Buka-noyan. Then it started!</p>
<p>Julien count of Sidon, without cause or warning, fell on a
Mongol patrol. Kit-Buka's nephew was among the dead. The infuriated Mongols
slaughtered Sidon, and the Crusaders trumpeted Mongol ferocity to the whole
world.</p>
<p>The Mamluk advance guard left Egypt on 26 July 1260 without
the baggage train and passed the Sinai desert at a trot, destroyed a small
Mongol covering force at Gaza and then entered the lands of the Franks and
received the provisions necessary to the troops under the walls of Acre. There
the Mamluks rested, regrouped and, passing through the territory of the Kingdom
of Jerusalem, came into Galilee in the rear of the Mongol army. At Ain-Jalud on <b><font COLOR="#943634">{200}
</font></b>3 September 1260 the Mongol and Armenian force was
smashed and Kit-Buka himself taken prisoner. The latter, a true paladin of the
cross, bore himself extremely manfully. He asked no mercy, but accused the
victorious Kuttuz of the murder of the legal sultan, contrasting Mongol fidelity
to the crimes of the Mamluks. They cut off his head without delay.</p>
<p>Kuttuz marked his triumphant entry into Damascus by a
slaughter of the Christians living there. Hulegu tried to help his allies and
flung a new army into Syria which should have taken Aleppo, but a few days later
was smashed by the Mamluks at Horns on 10 December 1260 and retreated beyond the
Euphrates. This victory was won by the new Mamluk sultan, Baybars, who had just
murdered his best friend and comrade, Kuttuz, in October of the same year, 1260,
so rich in events. The conqueror of Kit-Buka outlived his prisoner by only two
months.</p>
<p>Subsequent events followed like an avalanche which you can
push or not push, but which you cannot stop. After betraying the Mongols and
Armenians whom they did not allow to mount a counter-offensive until 1263, the
Crusaders remained alone with the Mamluks. The death throes of the Kingdom of
Jerusalem lasted 31 years, until 18 May 1291 when the last Crusaders left the
shores of Syria. The consequences of what they had done, however, stretched into
beautiful France where the Templars fell a victim to the cunning of those they
sincerely considered their best friends, the King of France and the Pope.</p>
<p>The terrible case against the Templars accused of worshipping
Baphomet, cursing sacred objects and many other sins of which they were
unwilling to consider themselves guilty, dragged on from 1307 to 1313. But, in
the intervals between tortures, did they, fettered to the walls of the French
dungeons, recall that it was thanks to their order, to the deeds of their
predecessors, that the Christian population of Syria had been destroyed, the
allies coming to their aid had been killed by the enemy and that, thanks to all
this, the aim of the Crusades - the Holy Land - had once and for all been lost?
But even if these thoughts never entered their heads, the logic of events was
such that the enemies of their friends went to the stake that had been prepared
for them by their deeds.</p>
<p>The position of the Mongols in Iran became no less tragic.
The idea of founding a Christian kingdom in the Near East had been lost as the
lands occupied by Christians fell into the hands of the enemy.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{201} </font></b>At the same time Baybars
entered into relations with his fellow tribesmen in the Golden Horde and won
Berke-khan over to his side. Enmity had long been growing between Hulegu and
Berke on account of differing cultural and political trends. About 1256, when
the Yellow Crusade began, Berke had exclaimed: &quot;We put Mongke-khan on the
throne, but how does he reward us for that? He repays us with evil against our
friends, violates our treaties ... and covets the possession of the caliph, my
ally ... There is something foul in this!&quot;  <a name="sik3text117"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note117">[+117]</a>
Berke did not count it foul to murder his nephew and execute his brother's wife.</p>
<p>In accordance with the Mongol Yasa, however, the Golden Horde
detachments fought in the forces of the Ilkhan during the campaigns against
Baghdad and Damascus. But after the defeat of Kit-Buka, Berke sent orders to his
commanders to leave Hulegu's army and, if they could not manage to return home,
to go to Egypt. This they did, increasing the number of the Mamluk troops
(1261).  <a name="sik3text118"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note118">[+118]</a> After
this, war between the Golden Horde and Iran was only a matter of time. It was
evidently not by chance that Berke founded an Orthodox bishopric in Sarai in the
same year. The friend of the Mamluks and enemy of the Nestorians sought support
in the Orthodox church and in Rus`.  <a name="sik3text119"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note119">[+119]</a></p>
<p>In essentials, the fifth act in the tragedy of the Kingdom of
Prester John ended in 1261, but it had an epilogue which developed in the Far
East. Now China, inundated with blood, and the Mongol steppe, illuminated by the
sun in the years up to and after Mongke's death, will be the scene of action.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>War in China</h4>
<p>In 1253 Kubilai outflanked the Song empire on the west. He
led his troops from Shaanxi to Sichuan and conquered the independent kingdom of
Nanzhao in the south of China. Unlike Hulegu, Kubilai forbad that the
inhabitants of the capital that had surrendered be killed and thus strengthened
Mongol power in Sichuan.  <a name="sik3text120"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note120">[+120]</a>
This was <b><font COLOR="#943634">{202} </font></b>so
unusual that Mongke summoned Kubilai to explain,  <a name="sik3text121"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note121">[+121]</a>
and command of the southern army passed to Uriyangqadai, son of the famous
Sube-'etei; he subdued the Tibetan and Burmese troops, took Hanoi in 1257 and
came out in the rear of the Song empire.</p>
<p>Yet, despite many individual successes, final victory eluded
the Mongols. Therefore, in September 1258 Mongke again convoked a kuriltai and
himself took command in China. He entered Sichuan with a new specially selected
army and began a systematic siege of the Chinese forts, i.e. the enemy's support
points. Many of them were taken, but the town of Hezhou resisted and dysentery
among the Mongols made them withdraw their forces.</p>
<p>The great khan of the Mongols himself died beneath the walls
of Hezhou on 11 August 1259 leaving his brother Kubilai, who at that time was
advancing on China from the north, an army, huge by the Mongol scale, and
Uriyangqadai's detachment, a reinforced levy gathered from the conquered Burmese
and Annamites. In this army the Mongols formed an absolute minority, but its
conventions were Mongol and fidelity to the khan was guaranteed because
desertion in China was equivalent to an agonised suicide. Thanks to this turn of
events, Kubilai became the most powerful of all the Mongol princes.</p>
<p>The dead khan had been &quot;staid, decisive, spoke little,
did not like feasting and used to say of himself that he followed the example of
his ancestors. He had a passion for hunting and believed to an insane degree in
wizards and soothsayers. He summoned them at every enterprise and passed not a
single day without them.&quot;  <a name="sik3text122"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note122">[+122]</a>
On the other hand, his younger brother, Arik-Boke, who had publicly asserted
that &quot;The Messiah is God&quot;, was a fervent Christian. The intelligent
and restrained Kubilai had for the time being not declared his views. The fourth
of their contemporaries, Berke-khan of the Golden Horde, had not only accepted
Islam, but, as noted above, also arranged the slaughter of Nestorians in
Samarkand. Incidentally, his antipathy to Christianity did not extend to the
Orthodox and he did not break off the friendship with Aleksandr Nevskii.  <a name="sik3text123"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note123">[+123]</a></p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{203} </font></b>Such was the disposition of
forces in Mongke's lifetime, but after his death it became evident that there
was no one to maintain the old traditions. The comrades of Chinggis had become
old and died.  <a name="sik3text124"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note124">[+124]</a>
Their children had spent their entire life on campaign and were tired. Now, the
grandchildren should have their say. But they had been won round, as we have
seen, some by Nestorians, some by Buddhists, some by the Muslims. The old Mongol
tradition had been poured out too widely to remain of a piece and the streams
formed from this source could not, and did not wish to, flow along one course.
Unavoidable events meant a delay of only half a year.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Two Kuriltais</h4>
<p>According to Mongol law, the Yasa, on the death of a khan the
troops and princes should gather for a kuriltai in their native Mongol steppe.
There, again in agreement with custom, Tolui's youngest son, Arik-Boke, ruled.
Immediately on learning the news of his brother's death, Arik-Boke began the
preparations for calling a kuriltai in Karakorum which should put him on the
throne.</p>
<p>There was nothing to show that Arik-Boke himself possessed
outstanding abilities or excessive energy, but even had he had these qualities,
they would have been insufficient to incline the sympathies of the entire Mongol
people and troops to his side. So we have to find the groupings which supported
his candidature or, more accurately, put this prince forward as a candidate for
the throne <i>in </i>order then to rule the country with the help of his name
and title. This is not so difficult. The Nestorian sympathies and support of the
first minister, Bulgai, a Kerait and Nestorian, show quite clearly what force
gathered around the name of Arik-Boke.</p>
<p>Moreover, strict legality inclined the majority of the
Chinggisid princes to his side, including Alqui, khan of the Chagatai ulus, and
Qaidu, ruler of the Mekrin region (in the Eastern Tianshan). Even the troops
Mongke had brought into Shaanxi and Sichuan  <a name="sik3text125"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note125">[+125]</a>
were ready to support Arik-Boke, but Kubilai was able to seize the initiative.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{204} </font></b>On 4 June 1260 in the new
Mongol town of Shangdu (Shandu)  <a name="sik3text126"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note126">[+126]</a>
(Kaipinfu, founded by Kubilai in 1256) by Lake Dolonnor, on the borders of China
and Mongolia (Chakhar and Zhekhe), Kubilai gathered his warriors for a kuriltai
and proclaimed himself great khan with their agreement. This was a direct
violation of the law, for which the death penalty was laid down What guided the
mutinous prince and, what is still more important, those who chose him?</p>
<p>This can only be answered after looking at the composition of
Kubilai's army Whoever did it lack? Jurchen and northern Chinese, Ongut
(descendants of the Turkic Shato) and Tangut, Burmese, Tibetans, Muao, Lolo,
A-vu and Annamites brought from the south by Unyangqadai, Kipchak and Yasy,
Turks from Central Asia and Russians recruited by the baskaks, Mongols were the
fewest of all. Only two princes from the Chinggisids were mentioned Kadan,
Ogedei's son, and Togachar, Temugeotchigin's son. But this assemblage, bound by
an iron discipline, had been tested in battle Here, what was common to all was
not one's creed, love of one's homeland, traditions inherited from one's
ancestors, but an understanding of one's own advantage and an ability to use
one's strength. By the last should be understood not only the number of spears
and sabres, but also the presence of a deep, rich and pacified rear North and
West China which had come to terms with the conquerors twenty years before,
thanks to the measures taken by Ye-lu Chu-cai. Though the great chancellor had
died in disgrace, the fruits of his labours had ripened and Mongolia was again
face to face with China, though now the latter was headed by an honourable
Mongol prince.</p>
<p>Sometimes personal advantage was stronger than principle. The
Ongut princes, the Nestorians Kun-buka and Ai-buka (Sun bull and Moon bull),
joined Kubilai's side. However, their children broke with their ancestors'
religion and went over to Catholicism, as we shall see below It cannot be ruled
out that at this time the split in the Far Eastern Christian Church had taken
shape.</p>
<p>According to his ideas, the Ilkhan Hulegu should have been on
the side of Arik-Boke, because he was surrounded and guided by Nestorian
advisers, the initiators of the Yellow Crusade against the Muslims But, alas,
the Ilkhan's hands were tied The Mamluk offensive in Syria and the rising of Ulu
David that took place at the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{205} </font></b>same
time in Georgia tied down the Mongol forces and chained them to the western
frontier. The rising by the Georgians was suppressed, but the occupation of
Transcaucasia by the Iranian Mongols created a conflict with the Golden Horde
which had hitherto considered these lands its own. Apart from this, the Golden
Horde Nestorians tended to look to Iran <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik3text127"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note127">[+127]</a></font>
which exacerbated Berke's relations with Hulegu. In short, Hulegu, by the force
of circumstances, had to side with Berke's enemies.</p>
<p>Berke, however, wanted only one thing: to pay nothing to the
great khan. Therefore, at first he recognised the distant Kubilai, but as soon
as it became clear that victory was inclining to the latter, Berke changed his
sympathies to Arik-Boke. This did not mean at all that he intended to support
him actively, but by this action he involuntarily pushed Hulegu into an alliance
with Kubilai which was also symbolic. Thus, if we start by looking at the actual
events, the Nestorian problem appears as background to them; but if we
generalise, we see that religious passions united and divided people along with
political considerations, while the background for the former was the
development of nomad culture opposed to the sedentary neighbours who had entered
their last battle against it. Let us see how it went.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Arik-Boke</h4>
<p>Both sides immediately proceeded to decisive actions. Hardly
had news of Kubilai's unauthorised conduct reached Karakorum, when in the autumn
of 1260 Arik-Boke was declared khan there. Kubilai flung his forces to the north
and routed Arik-Boke's troops on the Ongin; this compelled Arik-Boke to withdraw
to the upper Enisei. At the same time, Kubilai's plenipotentiaries were able to
suppress a disturbance in Shaanxi. Some of Arik-Boke's adherents were captured
and executed, some retreated west to Ganzhou and further, into the valley of
Etzingol where a Mongol force led by Alemdar strengthened them. Their attempt to
pass to the offensive, however, ended with their complete slaughter in the
desert east of Ganzhou. Reassured about his left flank, Kubilai occupied
Karakorum with a garrison and returned to Shangdu.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{206} </font></b>Arik-Boke sent a message to
Kubilai that he considered his own conduct madness, repented of it and would lay
down his weapons. I see no reason to disbelieve his sincerity, because Kubilai,
knowing his brother well, believed him. But the unfortunate prince was needed by
his party as a symbol, and at the end of 1261 Arik-Boke's troops seized
Karakorum and dashed south, rushing to catch Kubilai unawares.</p>
<p>On the southern border of the Gobi Kubilai's veterans halted
the Mongol onslaught, but the khan forbad pursuit of his opponent Probably, he
alone in his army did not want the destruction of his country. A second Mongol
offensive was also halted. Even then Kubilai restricted himself to stopping the
despatch of provisions from China to Mongolia Famine started there and Arik-Boke
with his troops, or perhaps, more truthfully, the troops with their khan,
retreated to the western edge of Mongolia.</p>
<p>Here a new calamity struck Arik-Boke. The Chagataid Alqui
betrayed him and went over to Kubilai. The advance guard of Arik-Boke's troops
sent against the traitor were routed in 1262 Alqui, intoxicated by his victory,
returned to his headquarters and disbanded part of his troops Arik-Boke took
advantage of his carelessness and took Almalik, and then he obliged Alqui to
flee to Samarkand But here the &quot;force of circumstances&quot; again
appeared. The embittered adherents of Arik-Boke began to deal so harshly with
the population of the regions they had seized, and particularly with Alqui's.
Mongol troops who had not succeeded in going off to the Tianshan in time, that
they made another part of Arik-Boke's troops indignant and they went over to the
side of Kubilai.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Alqui established contact in Samarkand and Bukhara
with the Muslim population, received large sums from them to re-form his army
and allowed his stepson and heir to go over to Islam. In 1263 Alqui routed Qaidu,
Ogedei's grandson, an adherent of Arik-Boke, and jointly with Kubilai's troops
caught Arik-Boke and his weakened and demoralised army in a pincer movement.</p>
<p>In 1264 Arik-Boke and the remnants of his adherents threw
themselves on Kubilai's mercy. He handed the prisoners over for trial, Arik-Boke
was pardoned, but all the others were executed, including Bulgai.</p>
<p>The court's sentence, evidently well founded, although its
motives have not survived in our sources, shows that it was not <b><font COLOR="#943634">{207}
</font></b>Arik-Boke's ambition which caused the bloody war
(otherwise he too would have lost his head), but the bitterness which had arisen
in the struggle between the parties into which the Mongol forces had divided.
The children of the former conquerors of the world suffered defeat, while the
children of the conquered and subjugated were victorious. But this was still not
the end of the Mongol tragedy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>Qaidu</h4>
<p>Immediately after the victory, in 1264, Kubilai transferred
his residence from Kaiping (i.e. Shangdu) to Beijing and deprived Karakorum of
the name of capital, and in 1271 he gave his dynasty the Chinese name of Yuan;
he himself was converted from khan to Emperor and &quot;Son of Heaven&quot;.
Mongolia appeared to be turned into a province ... no, not of China, but of an
extra-ethnic military monarchy based on the dominance of the subjugated
countries by a faithful hired army. After receiving from the west, from the
Ilkhan Abaga and khan Berke, numerous reinforcements, Arabs, Persians, Alans,
Kipchak and other peoples, <font COLOR="#ff0000"> <a name="sik3text128"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note128">[+128]</a></font>
Kubilai renewed the war against the Song empire, which had arrested his
emissary, and he completed its subjugation by 1279. In this time his opponents
in Western Mongolia managed to reorganise themselves. Prince Qaidu became the
last Paladin of Mongol military fame.</p>
<p>As distinct from his predecessor Arik-Boke, Qaidu was
ambitious and talented. Unobserved, he allowed certain groups to play their own
games, but he was, rather, using them for his own ends. But no aspirant can win
without some support, without a certain mood among the masses. Qaidu was no
exception: he knew where to look for and how to find comrades.</p>
<p>The Mongols lived on the shores of the Imil and the slopes of
Tarbagatai, remaining faithful to their old customs and steppe form of life.
They were the antithesis to Kubilai's soldiers who devoted themselves to war and
revelry as China was being conquered. &quot;Undoubtedly&quot;, writes R.
Grousset, &quot;they were staggered by the transfer of the capital to China and
the conversion of the khanate <b><font COLOR="#943634">{208} </font></b>into
an empire&quot;.  <a name="sik3text129"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note129">[+129]</a>
These changes were foreign and repellent to them, and it was this mood that
Qaidu made use of when he became leader of all the western Mongols.</p>
<p>It is not worthwhile being distracted from our subject by
following all the upheavals of the Mongol prince's stormy biography, the more so
since it has been done more than once.  <a name="sik3text130"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note130">[+130]</a>
Suffice it to say that, after uniting under his banner all the Mongol princes
and khans of Central Asia, in 1275 Qaidu began a war with Kubilai and carried it
on until his death in 1301. The war did not consist so much of large-scale
battles, as of manoeuvres, raids and counter-raids. Kubilai opposed his kinsmen
with Kipchak (Polovtsy) cavalry which fought splendidly in steppe conditions.
Under Qaidu the religious problem receded into the background, since, apart from
Nestorians, Central Asian Muslims and followers of the &quot;Black Faith&quot;
were on his side, in other words, all the defenders of the traditions of
Chinggiskhan's empire. They were not victorious, but neither did they suffer
defeat.</p>
<p>A single episode of this war is of special interest to us
since it is linked with our problem. This is a rising by the eastern Chinggisids,
descendants of Chinggiskhan's brothers amongst whom the most powerful and
energetic was Naya, a descendant of Temugeotchigin. Like Constantine the Great,
Naya set forth against Kubilai raising the cross on his banner.  <a name="sik3text131"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note131">[+131]</a></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Naya</h4>
<p>In order to understand the causes and circumstances for the
new outburst of religious war in the Far East we must cast a glance at the
history of the build up of such a tense collision. After the Christians had been
expelled from China (end of the tenth century), competition between Buddhists
and Taoists flared up there. At first the balance seemed to be in favour of the
Buddhists whom the Khitan and Tangut bishops supported, then in 1223 Chan-chun,
a Taoist monk, was able to obtain from Chinggiskhan the freedom of Taoist <b><font COLOR="#943634">{209}
</font></b>monks from al] duties, taxes and dues.  <a name="sik3text132"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note132">[+132]</a>
Overjoyed by this high favour, the Taoists began to seize Buddhist monasteries
and cast out images of the Buddha, replacing them with statues of Lao-zi.</p>
<p>Under Ogedei, Ye-lu Chu-cai, a former true Buddhist, somewhat
limited the activity of the Taoists.  <a name="sik3text133"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note133">[+133]</a>
Mongke, too, inclined to the Buddhist side, organising a disputation in 1255
which the Buddhists won. But the cunning politician Mongke openly declared that
to him the five religions were like the five fingers of a hand, all equally
necessary and dear.  <a name="sik3text134"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note134">[+134]</a>
The next step was taken by Kubilai who organised the Buddhist victory at a
disputation in the town of Shangdu in 1258. After this the Taoists were driven
from the monasteries they had seized and their anti-Buddhist treatises were
condemned to the flames by decree in 1258, 1261, 1280, 1281.  <a name="sik3text135"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note135">[+135]</a>
This might be called religious persecution.</p>
<p>The Nestorians were the most quarrelsome and obstinate of all
the representatives of the Christian creeds. They managed to quarrel with the
Greeks who supported the Muslim, and with the Muslim who had acquired influence
in the Kara-Khitan khanate, and with the wizards of the &quot;Black Faith&quot;,
and, finally, with the Buddhists. They only maintained peace with the Taoists
whom the Christians esteemed partly for the strictness of their monastic rule,
and still more because they did not attempt to propagate their teaching beyond
China proper. Therefore, the triumph of Buddhism, damaging to Taoism, offended
Nestorianism as well. Naya and his cousins had portions in Eastern Mongolia and
Northern Manchuria, dominating warlike tribes whose risings had once used to
alarm the Liao Empire. We have no information on the propaganda of Nestorianism
in these regions, but the very presence of a Christian movement directed against
Buddhism  <a name="sik3text136"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note136">[+136]</a> shows
that Nestorian missionaries had not worked here without effect.</p>
<p>The insurgents had no little chance of success. Kubilai's
best troops were tied down in Dzungaria by the war with Qaidu and Kubilai had to
reinforce the army thrown against Naya with Chinese. The fleet, summoned from
the mouth of the Yangzi, carried the army to the mouth of the Liao He where it
encountered <b><font COLOR="#943634">{210} </font></b>the
Mongol host which had halted for a rest. Kubilai, although he was 72 years old,
directed the battle from a tower carried by four elephants. Catching Naya
unawares, he surrounded his camp, deprived him of freedom of manoeuvre and
obliged the Mongols to engage in hand to hand combat. The battle lasted from
dawn to noon, and the Chinese infantry overcame the Mongol cavalry because the
latter were unable to deploy. The rebels threw themselves on the mercy of the
conqueror. However, they were refused mercy. Naya, being of noble birth, was
allowed to die without bloodshed. He was wrapped in a large felt and crushed by
twisting the ends. Kubilai transferred command of the troops to his grandson,
Temur, and returned to Beijing, but war in the north continued. Prince Kadan,
who made an attempt to pass to the offensive, headed the insurgents. Temur flung
himself forward to meet him and fierce battles developed in north-western
Manchuria on the shores of the Nonni. Temiir won two victories, in 1288 and
1289, and compelled the mutineers to surrender. The punishment was severe: Kadan
and the other leaders of the rising lost their heads, while the ordinary
soldiers lost their freedom. The prisoners were sent into exile to the Ordos and
Amdo where they had a very bad time.  <a name="sik3text137"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note137">[+137]</a></p>
<p>The Christian religion as such was not liable to persecution,
but was merely put under special surveillance: in 1289 Kubilai founded the
&quot;Directorate of Christian Affairs&quot;.  <a name="sik3text138"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note138">[+138]</a>
Evidently, the Ongut had to be dealt with, formerly the most reliable support of
the throne. But here, too, the intelligent ruler found a solution.</p>
<p>Let us recall that Kubilai had had a Christian education,
though, as a Chinggisid, he had not been baptised. Political, not ideological
motives separated him from his coreligionists and so he turned his attention to
another creed of the Christian faith, i.e. Roman Catholicism. In the mid
sixties, i.e. immediately after the rout of Arik-Boke, Kubilai proposed that the
Venetian merchants Nicolo and Maffeo Polo deliver his letter to the Pope. He
wanted to establish relations with the Catholics and asked for missionaries to
be sent,  <a name="sik3text139"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note139">[+139]</a>
evidently in order to establish his own church, looking towards him, not his
competitors.</p>
<p>The khan called the local Christians &quot;ignoramuses&quot;
because they <b><font COLOR="#943634">{211} </font></b>did
not know how to perform miracles, drive away bad weather and so on, which the
Buddhists, allegedly, could easily do. He declared that, if he had enough
educated clergy from the west, he and his people would convert to Christianity.  <a name="sik3text140"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note140">[+140]</a>
One would think the Papal throne would have to take up such a proposition, but
active Catholic propaganda commenced in China only in 1293, when Giovanni
Montecorvino, a Franciscan and future Archbishop of China, arrived in Beijing.  <a name="sik3text141"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note141">[+141]</a></p>
<p></p>
<h4>Prince George or Korkuz</h4>
<p>The Popes were not guilty of delay. They had no time at all.
Over the three decades from the departure of the Polo brothers from Latin
Constantinople (1259) to the appointment of brother Giovanni as a missionary to
China (1289) the map of the western borderlands of Eurasia had changed beyond
recognition. The Holy Land fell into the hands of the Mamluks, except for the
fortress of Acre, but even its days were numbered. In place of the Latin Empire
a renewed Byzantium proudly arose. In Italy, after the quite considerable
successes of the Ghibellines who seized Lombardy and Tuscany, Charles of Anjou
got control of the Kingdom of Sicily. The last Hohenstaufens perished either in
battle (Manfred), or on the scaffold (Conradin), but the French victors, too,
suffered bitter death at the sound of the bells of the Sicilian Vespers (30
March 1282). The intervention of Aragon extended the war in Italy until 1287,
when a short armistice was concluded, and Giovanni Montecorvino set off for the
east.</p>
<p>In point of fact, the mission was too late. After he had
suppressed the Christian risings of Naya and Kadan, Kubilai's sympathies had
been replaced by Buddhist ones, and Montecorvino tells us that the khan
&quot;had become fixed in paganism&quot;, but was cordial towards Christians.  <a name="sik3text142"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note142">[+142]</a>
But he straightaway quarrelled with the Nestorians who spread the rumour that
Montecorvino was a spy. A legal enquiry, without his being in custody, lasted
five years and ended in victory for the Catholic missionary whom the emperor
Temur (Kubilai's grandson) himself assisted. It is interesting to know why such
good fortune as the monarch's favour befell the Italian monk.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{212} </font></b>The point was that the enemy
of the Chinese Mongols, Qaidu, was not dozing. In 1297 he managed to reach the
Selenga.  <a name="sik3text143"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note143">[+143]</a> A
little more and Mongolia would have been freed from the dynasty which had linked
its fate with China. Only steppe cavalry decided the question, and that which
Temur had consisted of Ongut and Kerait, i.e. Nestorians. It was essential for
Temur to attract these troops to his own side, and there Montecorvino helped
him. He baptised prince Korkuz, a Nestorian, ruler of the Tenduk region,  <a name="sik3text144"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note144">[+144]</a>
into the Catholic faith and thus made him an enemy of the Nestorians and a
friend of Temur. Korkuz,  <a name="sik3text145"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note145">[+145]</a>
also called prince George, took the field with his Nestorian subjects on behalf
of the Buddhist emperor, and Qaidu's forces turned away to the sources of the
Black Irtysh. There, too, in 1298  <a name="sik3text146"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note146">[+146]</a>
the prince who had betrayed his faith perished. He fell a prisoner to Qaidu and
he was beheaded. This means that the war was more than usually fierce, for
Korkuz could have counted on death without bloodshed.</p>
<p>In point of fact, the participation of the Ongut and Kerait
on the side of the Beijing government decided the fate of the war. Qaidu's
offensive was halted and in 1301 the last champion of steppe traditions died.
Internecine war died out.</p>
<p>The coincidence in the dates of Korkuz's conversion and the
start of Montecorvino's rise affords no doubts but that it was for this that the
Catholic missionary obtained his privileges allowing him to found a bishopric in
Beijing. But how similar this is to the Templars in Acre! Again the Catholics
betrayed the Nestorians, this time to the Buddhists. Here a question arises,
what was this, chance, coincidence or a calculated system?</p>
<p>It is the more difficult to answer this question since
ill-will on the part of popes and prelates is known to be excluded. They acted
according to their consciences and the conceptions of their time. This frees
them of moral responsibility. However, the logic of events remains in force and
this is caught by our historyscope with a certain distancing and generalisation.</p>
<p>The iron band of dogma and philosophical axioms burst under
the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{213} </font></b>pressure
of ethnic and cultural development pushing the peoples of Romano-German Western
Europe along the road of particularisation. While in the eleventh century they
still considered the Greeks their brethren in religion and only wondered at how
these brethren differed from themselves, while in the twelfth century they
awaited the arrival of the eastern Christians as natural allies, then in the
thirteenth century all illusions had disappeared and, for Europeans, the peoples
not united under the papal crown had become foreign: heathen and, worse than
that, heretics. A deep ethnological meaning was concealed beneath this tightrope
walking with theological terms: the Europeans had separated themselves from the
rest of mankind and opposed themselves to it as the Arabs and Chinese had once
done, and in antiquity the Hellenes, Jews, Persians and Egyptians. Consequently,
here we observe a single process of ethnogenesis common to all times and
countries, just as undeflectable as is social development along a spiral. Once
this is so, we have no right to regard these events either as chance
coincidences, or as a political conspiracy of Europeans against Asiatics, but
should regard them as a naturally flowing process or regular pattern of
mankind's ethnic history in that harsh period when the time came for the
crystallisation of peoples alive and effective till now.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>Truth Instead of a Tale</h4>
<p>Intense activity by the Venetian, Genoese and Roman trade and
diplomatic agents who worked exceedingly conscientiously through the second half
of the thirteenth century produced its results. <i>The Book of the Great Caan</i>
  <a name="sik3text147"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note147">[+147]</a> generalising
all the information accumulated by European travellers replaced the Legend of
Prester John. The extant text is a translation from a Latin original into very
old French. In the opinion of the editor this is a Norman dialect with very free
orthography.  <a name="sik3text148"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note148">[+148]</a>
But the first sentences of the text give data for an exceedingly precise dating
of the lost original.</p>
<p>The great khan of China ('Le grand Caan de cathay') to whom
are subordinate all the seigneurs of the land is called the most mighty
sovereign; of their number three great emperors are distinguished: <b><font COLOR="#943634">{214}
</font></b>the emperor of Khanbalik  <a name="sik3text149"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note149">[+149]</a>
(cambabech), Busai (boussay) and Uzbek (usbech). It is later indicated that
Uzbek and Busai are at war with one another. It is completely clear that Uzbek
is the khan of the Golden Horde ruling in 1312-41, and Busai is Abu Sa`id,  <a name="sik3text150"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note150">[+150]</a>
Ilkhan of Iran whose name the Persians pronounced Bu S`aid. Comparing the dates
of their reigns we find they coincide for 1316-35 when, evidently, the source we
are concerned with was composed. The names of the Far Eastern khans were not
known to the compilers of the document. This indicates that the primary
information was collected in the Near East.</p>
<p>It is important to note that the compiler of the <i>Book of
the Great Caan </i>permitted an anachronism when he stated that all three
monarchs are subordinate to a fourth, the greatest, the khan of
&quot;Cathay&quot;. In the thirteenth century the Seven Streams area, i.e. the
former kingdom of Ye-lu Dashi was called Cathay. Here at the end of the
thirteenth century was the portion of Qaidu who claimed priority among the other
Mongol khans. In the fourteenth century these claims were inherited by the
Chagataid Duva; he died in 1306 after which the throne of the Chagatai ulus
passed to weak and insignificant rulers whose names,  <a name="sik3text151"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note151">[+151]</a>
but not their deeds, have survived. Their claims to dominance, if they made
them, were fruitless, but, it seems, the Italian compiler was insufficiently
informed of the true situation in Central Asia and expounded the political
situation as it had seemed to his informants, travellers at the end of the
thirteenth century.</p>
<p>This observation is extremely valuable for our investigation,
because it gives us the opportunity to ascribe the data about the Nestorians
quoted below to the end of the thirteenth century, i.e. to the period when they
were still struggling for dominance in the Mongol ulus. Nothing is said about
the Central Asian Nestorians, but two chapters are devoted to those who lived in
Khanbalik (Beijing).</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{215} </font></b>In them it says that the
Khanbalik Christian schismatics adhere to the Greek ritual and do not submit to
the Roman church, that they are ill-disposed towards the Catholics, exterminate
the Catholic monks in the night and do them as much harm as then can. But as the
emperor is well disposed to the Catholics, the Nestorians are somewhat
frightened. The Nestorians have many very fine churches with crosses and icons,
and are very concerned that their congregation should have no dealings with the
Catholic missionaries or the lay people converted to Catholicism, because,
thanks to the support, both administrative and financial, of the great khan, the
Catholics had managed to baptise many local nestorians and certain heathens
called by our source &quot;vritanes'(?!)  <a name="sik3text152"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note152">[+152]</a></p>
<p>This information agrees with data in the letter from the
Archbishop of China, Giovanni Montecorvino, to the chief vicar of the Franciscan
order in the Crimea written in Beijing on 8 January 1305. The prelate complains
a great deal about the Nestorians and indicates that he was saved only by the
intervention of the emperor who sent his enemies away from the capital. At the
same time he explains that his missionary activity was directed to rebaptising
the Nestorians; as for the heathen, he bought 150 children of seven to eleven
years and baptised them in the Catholic faith.  <a name="sik3text153"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note153">[+153]</a></p>
<p>The bitterness of the Nestorians becomes completely
understandable. But, you know, only half a century before this they had sought
an agreement with the Roman church and saved Europe, with their influence and
advice directing the main blow of the Mongol forces, who were not yet spent,
against Baghdad in the Yellow Crusade - i.e. they did what had been expected of
the pontiff John. All right, not a single good deed goes unpunished!</p>
<p>Catholic Europe refused to support the Ilkhan Abaga,
protector of the Christians, who asked Pope Clement IV in 1268 and Nicholas III
(1277-80) to organise a Crusade against the Egyptian Mamluks.  <a name="sik3text154"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note154">[+154]</a>
As a result the Ilkhan capitulated to the forces of Islam. In 1295 Argun's son,
Ghazan, who had gone over to the Muslim faith, came to the throne of Iran; he
marked his falling away from ancient Mongol traditions and the Yasa by formally
breaking the vassal relationships which bound Iran to the ulus of the Great
Khan.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">
{216} </font></b>The instability and
fluctuations of the Mongol nobility ruling in Iran is reflected in the names
selected for the last, though still strong, Ilkhans, Ghazan had the Muslim name
Mahmud; his brother and heir, Oljeitu, had in childhood been christened Nicholas
by his mother. The Persians mockingly nicknamed him Kharbande (slave of the
ass); on going over to Islam he changed this to Khudabande (slave of God),
although his official name became that of the Prophet - Muhammed.  <a name="sik3text155"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note155">[+155]</a></p>
<p>Ghazan and Oljeitu themselves still continued to take account
of their Christian subjects, but under the next sovereign, Abu Said, such
oppression of the Christians took place that the Mongol Nestorian community was
obliged in 1319 to rise in a revolt which was savagely repressed. After this,
only local natives remained Christians in Iran and Central Asia; their community
was destroyed by Timur.  <a name="sik3text156"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note156">[+156]</a></p>
<p>The guilt of the Papal throne and the French crown in the
tragedy that had taken place is not very great. They had simply deserted the
eastern Christians in their troubles; but Europeans do not count a failure to
help as a crime. Moreover, in the thirteenth century passions with a religious
tinge had flared up to such an extent that the Catholics refused to consider the
schismatics as co-religionists; this explains their deep indifference to the
eastern Christians who became the victims of a new outburst of Muslim
fanaticism.</p>
<p>But, on the other hand, the Catholics spared no efforts to
dismantle and weaken the Far Eastern community of &quot;treacherous Christian
heretics&quot;;  <a name="sik3text157"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note157">[+157]</a>
in this they succeeded. But it was by no means the Roman curia, nor the Catholic
kings nor even the Venetian seigniory which gained from this, but only medieval
geography; for the fables about the Kingdom of Prester John were replaced by the
sober and relatively true information on the Mongol ulus contained in the <i>Book
of the Great Caan.</p>
</i>
<p>The further fate of the Catholic bishopric in China was not
brilliant. In 1304, on a complaint by the Tao Church, the khan forbad the
baptising of Chinese, and he ordered prayers for his health to be said after the
Taoist and Buddhist services. In 1311 the <b>{217} </b>Buddhists took the churches on the banks of the Yangzi
away from the Christians and painted the frescoes of subjects from the Gospels
with images of Bodhissatvas and Dharmapala.  <a name="sik3text158"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note158">[+158]</a></p>
<p>This was evidently a reaction to the attempt by the Catholics
to attract khan Haisan, a drunkard and degenerate,  <a name="sik3text159"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note159">[+159]</a>
to their faith in 1310, but even here Montecorvino had no success.  <a name="sik3text160"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note160">[+160]</a>
After the death of the Archbishop of China which took place in 1328 the Catholic
community withered until 1368, i.e. until the overthrow of the Mongol dynasty.
The new victorious Ming dynasty was hostile to all trends of Christianity, which
gradually died under pressure from the Muslims and Buddhists.  <a name="sik3text161"></a><a href="sik3c.htm#sik3note161">[+161]</a>
The Nestorian monasteries in Uighuria lasted somewhat longer, but no one
considered them the Kingdom of Prester John.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>The Author's Approach and Bases for Scepticism</h4>
<p>We have looked at the whole history of Middle Asia from the
height of an eagle's flight and from the top of a high barrow burial. Something
has been made clear, but much has remained a mystery. Worse than that, the
number of mysteries has increased it seems.</p>
<p>In fact, when we dealt with the Hun and ancient Turks all was
clear: the nomads had their own specific way of life and, consequently, their
own ideology adapted to it. But the Uighur kaganate appeared and immediately
there occurs the conversion of the nomads to foreign religions brought from the
West and the East. In 841-7 the Manichaean theocratic state perishes, clearly
lacking vitality since the foreign religion had not been accepted by the people.
It would seem that the loss of Uighuria would deprive the nomads of a desire for
ideological borrowing. But that was not how it was! The greater part of them
accepts Christianity and not unsuccessfully adapts it to their established
culture. The value of Christianity to them, evidently, was not to establish
contact with the mainstream of this religion, but to oppose Chinese cultural
influence with something weighty and as valuable as Buddhism. If this is so, why
did the Mongols disdain it? Evidently we need to look into <b><font COLOR="#943634">{218}
</font></b>the details of Mongol religion, but you will not do
this with a bird's eye view.</p>
<p>Then, it is incomprehensible why the Mongols and the
Nestorians, after a few clashes, began to get on peacefully with one another.
There were about 13,000 Mongols in Chinggiskhan's army, but in total it amounted
to 130,000. Why should 90% of the bold warriors submit to 10%, leaving aside the
auxiliaries? And not only submitted, but also fought for the nine-tailed banner
to the last drop of their blood. Finally, how did Nestorianism cease to possess
their minds and why did it disappear? All is unclear!</p>
<p>Evidently the approach we have made to the subject is not
universal, but it has served its purpose. If we did not have the full range of
the historical phenomena, such questions would not have come into our head. We
would not even have pondered on the gaps in Asia's history and would have
remained in a blissful ignorance hidden by general phrases about development,
progress and stagnation. Now, though, we have grounds to turn again to the
sources and attempt to extract from them the information that is lacking.</p>
<p>The work on the texts requires a quite different approach.
The trivialities, reservations of medieval authors, coincidence or lack of it
between different versions, the emotional load and the literary devices - these
are a new field for the investigator which, we hope, may prove fruitful; for now
we shall not be building brick by brick, but focussing our attention on details
of interest unclear to us. But, first of all, the question of reliability. What
is the sense in studying someone else's lie, even if it is an ancient one? To
solve the new problem we shall look at the same events as if from a mouse-hole,
limiting ourselves, of course, to the small landscape which can be seen from
there.</p>
