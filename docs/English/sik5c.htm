Hypotheses</a></h3>
<h4>What is Wrong Here?</h4>
<p>This book on searches for an imaginary kingdom has been
written, but even the author looks at it with unconcealed surprise: there is so
much not included.</p>
<p>To start with, the sources have neither been fully marshalled
nor fully described. But then, had they been, there would have been no room for
anything else and this would have been quite another book which would not have
answered any of the questions troubling us. Even knowing who said what and when,
we would not have been able to point out who had unwittingly made a mistake and
where, or who was consciously concealing things with the veil of allegory. Our
work would have been in vain.</p>
<p>The literature on the question has been very little used. A
bibliography on all the subjects mentioned could amount to a list of many
hundreds of articles and books. But it is impossible to make a single horse out
of thousands of mice. The criterion of reliability is not to be found in words,
but in facts, i.e. in historical events, in their connections and sequence, and
both of these are in the book. The thread of historical regularity has run from
the Turks to the Mongols over three centuries which have hitherto been a blank.</p>
<p>Yet even the history is depicted extremely unevenly. Many
dramatic pages have been passed over. For example, would the reader not be moved
by the unequal struggle of the small Turk-Shato tribe against China's many
millions? This struggle was waged for the right of some to live and be
themselves, and the aspiration of the others to save their country from nasty
and hostile foreigners. Both sides were right in their own eyes and the problem,
as we have seen, was resolved by force. One should write a whole book about this
alone, not part of a chapter. Yes, of course, but then one would have to forget
about the Mongols and Nestorianism.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{358} </font></b>And the Khitan? ...
Their history has something in common with the period of Peter the Great who,
like Ye-lu Deguang, opened his country to foreign ideas and fashions. Of course,
both country, people and period have little in common with eighteenth-century
Russia, but then this, too, is interesting as it discloses the part played by
setting and situation. Yet this is also only mentioned in passing in the book,
since the fate of the Liao Empire is only a background for our subject, and we
have looked at flourishing Liaodong from the Mongol steppe, battered by the
winds.</p>
<p>The same should be said about the Tangut and the Uighurs, the
Karluk and the Kipchak (Polovtsy). Their rich cultures, their passionate
history, their unique cast of mind are not reflected in the book. There are only
outlines, lacking colour and shade, a general background against which the
ancient Mongols stand out boldly. Yet this is not a defect of the book, but a
means calling the reader's attention to the fact that the history of these
peoples is not exotica, not empty collecting of information (a sort of stamp
collection), not a kaleidoscope, but a composite part of the grandiose tragedy
of medieval world history.</p>
<p>In this spectacle we see a fierce logic of events, a pattern
in the birth and death of peoples, a responsibility for the deeds of
individuals, and that link between the history of mankind and of the biosphere
of planet Earth which has so far escaped researchers both in the humanities and
in the natural sciences. To find and fix this link is the true aim of my work
and to this end I have looked at the material in a special way. Perhaps it is
imperfect, but I know no other. My book is an experiment and one that does not
always succeed straightaway. But even if 605 attempts are fruitless, the six
hundred and sixth, the successful one, justifies all the effort.</p>
<p>Finally, the main theme itself, Central Asian Nestorianism,
looks somehow without weight, even transparent. That is true, but that it how it
was. Despite the extensive dissemination of Christian views throughout the Great
Steppe, they did not cross the threshold which allows historical incarnation.
Nestorianism did not make the final spurt, did not become a historical unity ...
and it came to grief. Well, an interrupted process is for the historian a most
interesting variant of historical development. Failure is no less a worthy
object of research than success, the more so since the details disclosed have
enabled us to explain certain important features concerning both Mongolia, and
also ancient Rus`.</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{359} </font></b>So, we have answered
the first question posed at the start of the book: what was there really?</p>
<p>And we have also found an answer to the second question: how
are we to squeeze truth out of falsehood? The principle turned out to be simple:
every author trying to convince his contemporaries of something must set out
undoubted, truthful information for them, and then flavour it with the spice of
tendentiousness. Consequently, the historian's task is to separate these two
components, and this is called historical analysis.</p>
<p>Further on it becomes more difficult. For analysis to succeed
one has to apply a panoramic and stereoscopic method, to fill in the obscure
places with isolines, to look at the object with different degrees of
approximation; in this complex way one can obtain a groundwork of reliable facts
and synthesise the ethnic and cultural process, guided by the logic of events.
But this result, too, we count as a semi-finished product. It is needed only to
make clear to us the world's causal and sequential links after applying it to
the laws of nature. Then this will be no longer simply a history of peoples, but
a science of peoples or ethnology.</p>

<h4>Ethnology</h4>
<p>Although the term &quot;ethnology&quot; has frequently been
applied in West European scholarship, this has always been done for different
reasons, with different meanings; thus, in a sense it has remained lexically
&quot;vacant&quot;. Therefore, when the Geographic Society of the Soviet Union
began work on generalising the problems of palaeoethnography and historical
geography,  <a name="sik5text75"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note75">[+75]</a> it was proposed to use this term for a branch of knowledge
including three mutually related problems: ethnogenesis, ethnogeographic
classification and the relation between ethnos and the landscape.  <a name="sik5text76"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note76">[+76]</a></p>
<p>The new perspective differs from that of all the disciplines
contiguous with ethnology, for example, from ethnography which deals with the
differences between proples, from sociology which is concerned with the forms of
the social movement of matter, from history which deals with events and their
links and sequence, from <b><font COLOR="#943634">{360} </font></b>physical
anthropology which is concerned with the physical type of the various branches
of mankind, i.e. races, and from evolutionary biology which looks at man as one
of the mammals. Perhaps the closest to ethnology in this new sense is holocene
palaeogeography, i.e. the study of the period in the earth's history when human
activity is clearly discernible. In this perspective mankind is regarded as a
certain covering of the planet Earth,  <a name="sik5text77"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note77">[+77]</a> or as part of the biosphere.  <a name="sik5text78"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note78">[+78]</a></p>
<p>The concept of the &quot;biosphere&quot; was introduced to
the scholarly world by V.I. Vernadskii to delimit the &quot;inert&quot; and the
&quot;live&quot; forms of substance. According to Vernadskii, the biosphere
consists of the totality of living organisms and the products of their activity,
for example, free oxygen in the atmosphere. That living organisms are not in
close contact with one another, but are separated by bits of inert matter, is,
according to Vernadskii, unimportant, for even in the hardest body there is
empty space between the molecules.</p>
<p>Extending Vernadskii's idea and developing his approach, we
distinguish the anthroposphere within the biosphere, i.e. the biomass of all
people together with the products of their activity: technology, dwellings,
domestic animals and cultivated plants. The anthroposphere, however, is not
monolithic, but a mosaic. The over-extensive diffusion of man, occupying almost
all of the planet's dry land, is related to a greater ability to adapt than that
of other mammals, and this, in its turn, has modified the species. Collections
of persons have been created which, when they arose, were linked with particular
natural conditions, though each of them later underwent its own history. We call
such a collective an ethnos, and we study these as a specific form of the
existence of the species <i>Homo sapiens </i>in historical conditions.
Ethnogenesis is the study of the causes of the rise and disappearance of ethni,
while ethnic classification is the study of the degrees of proximity between the
ethni themselves, which is essential to generalise the enormous and varied
material, and which has no analogies in methods and perspectives in the
humanities.</p>
<p>Ethnic history, as we have just seen, does not replace social
<b><font COLOR="#943634">{361} </font></b>history, but only complements it,
filling the vacuum inevitably formed with the strict application of merely a
single perspective.</p>
<p>Here the final question arises: why is all this necessary to
us? Let ethnology find its application in archaeology,  <a name="sik5text79"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note79">[+79]</a> physical geography,
 <a name="sik5text80"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note80">[+80]</a> ethnogeography,  <a name="sik5text81"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note81">[+81]</a> even in soil science;  <a name="sik5text82"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note82">[+82]</a> but how can it be useful in
criticising literary sources, in a matter with which the most humanitarian
branch of knowledge in the world - language and literature - is concerned? It is
essential that we answer this sensible question.</p>
<p>As we have already seen, reading historical narrative sources
does not mean we understand them. Yet without understanding the ideas and
attitudes of their authors, criticism of their constructions is impossible.
Consequently, we should become like the ancient Mongols who listened in their
yurts to the Secret History of their fathers and elder brothers from the mouth
of the reciter. But how are we to achieve this, how are we to reach a medieval
level of understanding if we receive the very best information on the period
from a source which is itself unclear to us? A dead end or, more truly, a
vicious circle.</p>
<p>But if we do not approach the reading of the source as
ignoramuses, but with a definite stock of historical analogies, general
knowledge of the period, a certain, even though very approximate, conception of
the psychology and philosophy of the medieval Asian peoples? Then we shall have
pegs on which to hang questions about the degree of reliability of the source,
and we shall be able to extract some, certainly incomplete, information from it.
Yet it will extend our horizon, make our conceptions more precise and allow us
to return to the text again, but at a higher level. And so we gradually
penetrate further, round by round, into the nuances which had hitherto escaped
us.</p>
<p>But while ethnology, thanks to its natural history methods,
can come <i>to </i>the help of the study of sources where pure, humanitarian
language and literary studies give up, it is itself extremely concerned to
obtain reliable information from the ancient sources. This information is the
diet of ethnology. But food should be of good quality, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{362}
</font></b>and the information obtained from the sources should be reliable. It
was for the sake of this high aim that we undertook our difficult journey
through the clefts in chronology and the debris of variant readings in the
authors&quot; versions. One would like to think that the labour expended will be
of use to scholarship, even to the extent of extending the possibility of
historical criticism. Perhaps we can even hope for something more: a
retrospective restoration of the course of events resulting from the disclosure
of the mechanism of their inter-relationship?</p>
<p>As the palaeontologist reconstructs the appearance of the
dinosaur from two or three bones, as the climatologist with the data of two or
three meteorological stations makes a weather forecast with increasing accuracy
year by year, as the geologist from a few outcrops or sections determines the
extent of sedimentary rocks, so the historian, using ethnological methods, can
describe the creation and destruction of a great or small empire, principality
or free town. Now, as well as the usual codification, he has to hand a method of
&quot;empirical generalisation&quot; which V.I. Vernadskii has claimed is as
reliable as actually observed fact.  <a name="sik5text83"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note83">[+83]</a> Let us try to apply this method to our
material.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4>An Attempt at a Review</h4>
<p>Let us try to return to the origin of the rumour about the
Kingdom of Prester John. As we have no direct evidence, let us proceed by
reasoning. To whose advantage was this rumour? Who could start and disseminate
it? Whom did they wish to deceive and why?</p>
<p>Naturally, we shall find no text with the answers to these
questions. People were not at all stupid in the middle ages and left no
documents compromising themselves. It remains to use the method of criminology -
<i>cui bono.</i></p>
<p>Let us recall that the rumour about Prester John reached
Germany from Syria, from the Christians there. So we may immediately exclude the
whole of Western Europe since it was it that was deceived. The whole Muslim
world also falls out of consideration because there was no sense in the Arabs
and Seljuks providing new incursions on the part of the Franks by encouraging
their hopes of help from the east. In the Orthodox countries the tale of an
eastern <b><font COLOR="#943634">{363} </font></b>Christian kingdom evoked no
enthusiasm, if only because Nestorians were the enemies of Byzantium and allies
of the Arab caliphs. Byzantine politicians could take account of reality,
however unpleasant, but they had no concern to dream up nightmares. East Central
Asia is also excluded for it could enter nobody's head there that the Kara-Khitan
khanate could be the leader of Near Eastern politics. There remains only Syria
itself and the Kingdom of Jerusalem.</p>
<p>In the 1130s the Kingdom of Jerusalem was in a flourishing
state, with which not a single state in Europe could compare. Free trade
enriched not only the Italian towns, Pisa, Genoa, Venice, but also the bastion
of the Jerusalem crown, the knightly Orders of Saint John and of the Templars,
as much as the princes of Antioch and Edessa.</p>
<p>Constant war with the Muslims and Greeks was seen by the
Frankish and Norman lords as a normal condition outside of which there would be
no place for them in life. War, particularly small and constant wars, was their
element. Of course, this war could not bring decisive victory over Islam, but
the knights did not strive for this, since for each one of them complete victory
would bring nothing but a small amount of the spoils of war. Income from the
frontier trade would be much greater.</p>
<p>In the fifty years since the First Crusade, the knights had
become accustomed to dealing with Muslims and began to see in them people worthy
of admiration and imitation. Their distant homeland seemed to become a wild,
provincial land, and the illiterate Norman or French barons seemed brutish,
boring and thick. Compared with the Arab emirs - poets and warriors - they were
just that.  <a name="sik5text84"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note84">[+84]</a></p>
<p>But in Europe they expected something quite different from
their eastern outpost. To the French and Germans it seemed just a bit more
pressure and the whole of Persia, the whole of Egypt would fall beneath the
hooves of the knights&quot; horses. But in 1144 there was a thunderclap - the
Turks took Edessa. The Holy Land seemed under threat. They had to go to the
rescue. Bernard of Clairvaux persuaded Louis VII of France and Conrad III of
Germany to take up the cross and the Second Crusade slowly began to be prepared.</p>
<p>The knights and barons in Jerusalem understood splendidly
that the Turks were enemies, but, not without reason, they doubted <b><font COLOR="#943634">{364}
</font></b>whether the French and Germans were friends. Power belongs to him who
has force and, if the French and German forces were to have appeared on the
shores of the Jordan and the Orontes, the barons of Jerusalem and Antioch would
have been compelled to become obedient servants. This they wanted least of all.</p>
<p>Yet it was also inexpedient to refuse help to repulse the
Turks. The very best way out for the Kingdom of Jerusalem was not to direct the
Crusaders` forces to Palestine, but directly to Mesopotamia from where the
danger threatened. But how could the French and German kings be tempted to
exchange an easy campaign in a rich country for an arduous war in deserts
scorched by the sun? That was when the rumour about the troops of a pontiff-king
allegedly standing on the banks of the Tigris reached Europe. Any commander
understands that to unite with an ally and take one's opponent in a pincer
movement is a guarantee of complete and easy victory. The author of the
invention, composed with talent and successfully distributed, was concerned that
the crusading kings should avoid Palestine and took steps towards that end,
using disinformation. He was not able to foresee that two years later the
offensive of the two most powerful monarchs in the Catholic world would misfire
even in Asia Minor (1147) and the pitiful remnants of the levy of knights would
beg the lords of Jerusalem for food and shelter, and not dictate to them their
will. That is the explanation which may be put forward as most probable,
although there is no certainty that it is the only correct one. But where there
can be no direct proof, one can either avoid answering the question, or reach a
conclusion on the basis of indirect considerations. We assume the second is more
honest.</p>
<p>Now, in connection with our observations made against a broad
historical background, let us think about where the legend of the excessive
savagery and fierceness of the thirteenth-century Mongol warriors came from. As
we have been persuaded, this legend did not correspond with reality, for
although the Mongols cannot be called good-natured, the Crusaders, Mamluks,
Khwarizmians and Jurchen conceded nothing to them in ferocity. Yet such a legend
existed even in the thirteenth century and so we can seek, if not the author, at
least the milieu where it arose and the aims it pursued.</p>
<p>Chinese historians were not biassed in this way. They drily
and impartially communicated the wonders of heroism and ferocity performed
equally by Jurchen and Mongols, without expressing <b><font COLOR="#943634">{365}
</font></b>sympathy for one or the other. War was in the Far East always taken
so seriously that mercy to prisoners was regarded as a betrayal of the state.
 <a name="sik5text85"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note85">[+85]</a> Against the background of endless wars with Huns, Turks, Khitan, Tangut and
Jurchen, Mongol tactics did not strike the Chinese chroniclers as anything
special, standing apart from the common run of events and the customs of war.
Moreover, the Mongols won their fiercest battles not against the Song, but
against the Jurchen who had themselves only just shown the Chinese what
slaughter of the peaceful population meant. Therefore, despite the general
Chinese hatred of nomads, it never occurred to the Chinese that the new enemy
could be reviled merely for the fact that he won more victories than the former
one had.</p>
<p>In the Near East the Armenians wrote a great deal about the
Mongols, but they sympathised with them as allies and so maintained a loyal
tone. The Russian chroniclers had a negative attitude to the Mongols, but their
works had little impact on Western Europe in the thirteenth century, so the
legend we are now concerned with did not come from Russian mouths. Moreover, the
anti-Tatar mood in Rus` became active in the fourteenth century, after the khans
of the Golden Horde had turned to Islam; and this did not happen at once, but
only when Mamai formed a coalition with the Catholics against Orthodox Moscow.
In the thirteenth century there had been a military alliance of the Horde and
Rus` and there had been many fewer causes for mutual bitterness.</p>
<p>The Muslims had the most hostile feelings to the Mongols,
both in conquered Iran and in victorious Egypt. Everything about the Mongols
irritated the Muslims: the Ilkhans` protection of Nestorianism, the destruction
of mosques, the prohibition of ritual washing and, finally, there was something
of the traditional enmity of the sedentary agriculturalist for the nomadic
herder. Cain was angry that Abel had given him what for. Yet it remains strange
that the West Europeans acquired the viewpoint of their bitterest enemies; after
all, the Mongols (after the death of Guyuk) intended no harm to Germany, Italy
or France. Yet it was Western Europe where the Mongols were hated most of all.</p>
<p>When the Mongol horses reached the azure Adriatic, Frederick
II, Emperor of the Holy Roman Empire and King of Sicily, expressed the opinion
that it would be good to use them as allies in <b><font COLOR="#943634">{366} </font></b>the
struggle against the Papal throne; but in 1241 the Mongols left and the
Emperor's idea was forgotten. Yet the nuance of political attitude is important:
antipathy to the Mongols did not arise among the Ghibellines. The Most Christian
King of Europe, Louis IX, the Holy, sent an embassy to Elchidei-noyan, and later
the French crown attempted to establish contact with the Ilkhans - so, it was
not a French affair. The Papal throne was entirely engrossed in its struggle for
existence. In the mid-thirteenth century it survived only thanks to the help of
Charles of Anjou and was then dependent on the French crown; so, it is scarcely
possible to talk of independent decisions by the Popes at the end of the
thirteenth century. Even if at this time they took a particular line, this means
it was suggested to them by someone. But leaving out Germany and France, as well
as England, Aragon and Castille who were not concerned with the Mongol problem,
we encounter the last influential Catholic state -the Kingdom of Jerusalem where
the Templars and the Order of Saint John shared power. It was precisely these
paladins of the Holy Sepulchre who felt the extreme need to explain to the
Christian world (i.e. Catholic Europe) why they had assisted in the defeat of
the Nestorian commander Kit-Buka and thus condemned their own fortresses, the
bridgehead of Christian aggression in the Near East, to fall to the Mamluk
sabres. Every normal European politician could and even must have asked them
after 1260 why they had committed their betrayal. Then the answer was invented:
the Mongols, allegedly, were fiends from hell, much worse than the Muslims and
in general than anyone else.</p>
<p>We have seen with what gullibility medieval Europe accepted
the tale of the Kingdom of Prester John. Here, though, was an interpretation of
events which appeared to the inhabitants as still more worthy of belief. Polish
and Hungarian refugees in 1241-2 certainly recounted the horrors that had
befallen their countries; the Russian emissaries of Mikhail of Chernigov and
Daniil of Galich poured oil on the flames, while those who could speak to the
contrary, for example, the Byzantines and the Cilician Armenians, were
themselves regarded in Western Europe as schismatics and enemies of
&quot;Christianity&quot;.</p>
<p>Of course, the critically thinking and widely informed
impartial historian should have compared the sacking of Baghdad or Damascus with
the devastation wrought by the Crusaders in Constantinople, yet had he done such
work, no one would have <b><font COLOR="#943634">{367} </font></b>supported him
in disseminating it in the Middle Ages they did not like to hear the bitter
truth about themselves. Apart from that, it was clear to all Catholic knights,
without any proof, that when they conquered the impious descendants of Hagar and
the Greek schismatics, this was not a crime, but a heroic deed, the knights were
unable even to conceive sharing their deserts with the Mongols, were they
threefold Christians. Therefore, that part of the information which confirmed
the Western world in the consciousness of its own pre-eminence was selected for
extensive use and the second conscious he by the Templars was a success.</p>
<p>But here I hear the reader protest &quot;It can't be! This is
the author's invention! Why should we disbelieve the well informed
contemporaries, the Templars, but believe a twentieth-century historian?&quot;
All right, reader, let us sort it out in the most usual way by comparing the
facts.</p>
<p>In 1287 the Ilkhan Argun, searching for allies against the
Mamluks, sent a Nestorian cleric, the Uighur Sauma, to Western Europe,
commissioning him to urge the Catholic kings to a new crusade. Sauma visited
Byzantium, Naples, Rome, Pans and Bordeaux, the domain of the English king
Everywhere he was accepted as an honoured and welcome guest. He was taken round
the churches and tombs of the saints as ambassadors are now taken round the
Louvre or the Hermitage Philipp IV and Edward I verbally promised help and an
alliance with the Mongols, the Nestorian was invited to church and the English
king received communion from his hands. Even Pope Nicholas IV allowed Sauma to
celebrate the eucharist and on Palm Sunday gave him communion from his own
hands.  <a name="sik5text86"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note86">[+86]</a></p>
<p>This was in the spring of 1288, but on 27 April 1289 Tripoli
fell and the evacuation of Europeans from Palestine began. That was when the
same pope sent Montecorvino to China, and we have seen why. The coincidence in
dates speaks for itself.</p>
<p>It would be odd to suppose that the surviving Crusaders took
the blame for their defeat on themselves To condemn the pope and the kings for
their situation would be extremely stupid, even dangerous. So then the second
story was created, no less fantastic than the first about Pope John. In the
course of the two decades when the <b><font COLOR="#943634">{368} </font></b>wandering
round Europe (1289-1307), it became popular version which everyone ceased to
doubt, so surprising as that 700 years later the legend of the ire of the
Mongols is dear to the European's intel-fact that the majority of medieval
conceptions have thrown out and are now regarded as curiosities. We out the
dog-headed men or the Amazon women, mongolophobia is an invention of the same
order. It is the distorted knowledge of an incidental object is attitude to it,
i.e. the question passes from the sphere the area of emotion and as a
consequence a sober les impossible.</p>
<p>Templars were wandering round Europe (1289-1307), it became the usual and popular version which everyone ceased to doubt.</p>
<p>But this is not so surprising as that 700 years later the legend of the exceptional nature of the Mongols is dear to the European's intellect, despite the fact that the majority of medieval conceptions have been reviewed, thrown out and are now regarded as curiosities. We smile reading about the dog-headed men or the Amazon women, but then, naive Mongolophobia is an invention of the same order. It is even worse, for the distorted knowledge of an incidental object is replaced by an attitude to it, i.e. the question passes from the sphere of knowledge to the area of emotion and as a consequence a sober approach becomes impossible.</p>
<h4>An attempt at interpretation</h4>
<p>It seems inexplicable that the Russian chroniclers tell us nothing about the Nestorians at the court of the Mongol khans, while the Chinese, Muslim, Armenian monophysites and Catholics write about this in great detail and readily. Ignorance on the part of the Russians is excluded. Yaroslav Vesvolodich and his son Andrei were at Guyuk's headquarters when it was full of Nestorians. Aleksandr Nevskii became Sartak's sworn brother and he was surrounded by Nestorians. In Mongke's reign, when Nestorians were in power, Russian craftsmen went to Karakorum for work. In brief, they could not but see and know that nomad Christians existed.</p>
<p>In some documents, however, there are unambiguous disclosures. In 1245, at the Lyons Council, the Metropolitan of Kiev, Petr Akerovich, stated in answer to questions about the Tatar faith:
&quot;They believe in a single lord of the world . . . [this might be understood as Mithraism, though the definition might equally refer to Christianity - LG] . . . God and his son in heaven, but Chirkhan on earth [This is not Mithraism for certain, nor Bon and not the Black Faith, since the second hypostasis of all of these is female - LG]. Each morning they raise their hands to heaven in honour of the creator [the Nestorian way of prayer, while the Orthodox put their hands together on their chest- LG]. If they eat, they throw the first piece into the air in honour of the creator, if they drink, they pour part onto the ground [this is not a religious, but an 'ethnographic' ritual - LG]. They say that their guide is Saint
John.&quot;</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{369} </font></b>There is no doubt that
the Metropolitan of Kiev knew no less than any of his contemporaries about
Nestorianism, but the information about this has not survived in the Russian
chronicles or the lives of the saints, but in <i>Rerum Britannicarum mediaevi
scriptores</i>.  <a name="sik5text87"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note87">[+87]</a></p>
<p>A second text is of quite a different nature. These are
answers of the Metropolitan see to questions from Feognost, Bishop of Sarai,
dated about 1269. &quot;Question. Is it proper, after blessing the bread and the
wine, to carry them from place to place and perform the liturgy with them?
Answer. It is proper since there is need. Wandering people [ nomads - L.G.] have
no place of rest; but take care with fear and trembling to place them in a clean
place and perform the service with them.&quot;  <a name="sik5text88"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note88">[+88]</a></p>
<p>This is dealing with the form of church service for nomads.
But for which ones? The Orthodox Alans (ancestors of the Osetians) and the
wanderers (ancestors of the Cossacks) lived sedentary lives; the baptised
Polovtsy fled from the Mongols to Hungary and Galicia. There remain only the
alien Mongol warriors, i.e. the Nestorians. But could an Orthodox bishop allow
heretics to take communion? Canonically, no. But let us try to glance at
history.</p>
<p>In the first half of the thirteenth century, the Orthodox and
Nestorians were enemies, but Berke's revolution (1257) and his persecution of
the Nestorians, supporters of his rivals, Sartak and Ulagchi, undermined the
significance of the Nestorian community as a political force. Under Mengu-Timur
relations between the Golden Horde and the Ilkhan Hulegu, who had protected
Nestorianism, deteriorated. The Nestorians in the Golden Horde were isolated
and, we may imagine, began to visit Orthodox churches. No special union was
needed. The unification of Christians within the Sarai eparchy, it seems, took
place gradually as a natural process.</p>
<p>Is it not in this historical modification that the solution
to the conspiracy of silence lies? At first, down to 1257, when the Nestorians
were a force, the Orthodox wanted to write badly of them, but did not dare.
Then, when the Orthodox church and the khan's authority had reached agreement,
and the humbled Nestorians had ceased to be dangerous, it became more <b><font COLOR="#943634">{370}
</font></b>advantageous to attract them to one's side rather than remind them of
the Council of Ephesus in 431, since when so much had passed. Times had changed,
and different relations between people had come about.</p>
<p>In the thirteenth century everyone needed faithful Tatars,
and in the understanding of the time &quot;faithful&quot; meant &quot;of the
same faith&quot;. Just as in the twelfth century the Torks, Black Cowls and
Berendei sought the protection of the princes of Kiev, so the Christian Mongols
must have clung to the southern border of the Russian land and kept quiet about
former differences. If our general ideas are correct, their descendants should
have remained there. And they are; these are the frontier smallholders <i>(pdnodvortsy)</i>,
Christians bearing Turkic names. They were never Muslim because the Tatars
converted from Islam to Christianity are called converts <i>(kryasheny); </i>we
shall speak below, in another connection, of the Tatar heroes who emigrated from
the Horde.</p>
<p>As distinct from the preceding hypothesis, this ethnogenetic
one can partly be checked and made more precise by ethnographic work carried out
from a particular viewpoint and subject to an aim set in advance. In order to
solve any problem it must first be posed. This is the sense of any hypothesis.</p>
<p></p>
<h4>An Attempt at Generalisation</h4>
<p>Now, knowing the real history of east Central Asia we shall
ask: could a state founded, like the caliphate, on the confessional principle
have been created there in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries? Yes it could.
In its structure it would recall  <a name="sik5text89"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note89">[+89]</a> the Turkic and Uighur kaganates, but,
perhaps, would be more stable and less aggressive. It would be a third variant
of Christian culture and would easily be perceived as an achievement of Europe
and the Near East, in constant opposition to Song China. Its economics would be
based on a combination of the nomadic herding and oasis agriculture of Uighuria;
transit caravan trade would flourish in it, <b><font COLOR="#943634">{371} </font></b>but
the possibility of distant military campaigns would not arise because the
&quot;people of long will&quot; would not have come to power, their rivals, the
Naiman, Kerait and Merkit, would have been victorious.</p>
<p>Who hindered this natural course of events? Chinggiskhan and
his Mongol veterans who did not build on the clan and tribal, but on the
military organisation which, by its very nature, decided all the external
political, cultural, ideological, social and economic problems by the long spear
and the sharp sabre.</p>
<p>He was undoubtedly a gifted man and his comrades in arms
possessed courage, but it is clear that the Mongols managed to win four external
wars (against the Polovtsy, Jurchen, Khwarizmian Turks and Tangut) not so much
as a result of Chinggiskhan's personal qualities, as from a deep crisis, more
precisely a turning point, affecting the whole of Europe, the Near and the Far
East in the thirteenth century. A feature of the period was the loss of
psychological and ethological (behavioural) themes which had an extremely
adverse effect on social and external policy problems. Speaking in general
terms, this expressed itself in personal interest being placed higher than the
collective one, and from this two consequences arose inertia and dissension. In
different regions this feature manifested itself in different ways according to
the local circumstances.</p>
<p>In Western Europe the economy grew rapidly and there were the
means to maintain the surplus military who, until the early thirteenth century,
had been sent packing to the land overseas (Palestine) In the thirteenth century
knights and townsmen were involved in the wars of Guelphs and Ghibellines,
princes and towns, of knights and condottieri with one another and between
themselves not for the sake of elevated though illusory principles, but for
personal gain. Forces, enormous for the time, counterbalanced one another within
the system or construction itself, and the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Latin
Empire were then lost, deprived of support from the centre. The competition of
Epirus and Nicaea, the splitting off of Trabzon, the egoistic policy of the
Serbs and Bulgars restrained even the victory of the Byzantines. All of them
were united by hatred for the Frankish aggressors, yet the war dragged out for
more than half a century because each one wanted to benefit at the others`
expense and so hindered achieving their common aim. The situation in Rus` was no
better The author of the Lay of Igor's</p>
<b>
<p><font COLOR="#943634">{372} </font></b>Host depicted it
laconically and aptly: &quot;Anguish spread over the Russian land; abundant
sadness flowed through the Russian land. And the princes themselves brought
dissension on themselves, and the pagans themselves with their victories raced
into the Russian land ...&quot;  <a name="sik5text90"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note90">[+90]</a> And it is true that had there been no mutual
dissension, there would have been no Tatars in Vladimir, Germans in Yur'ev or
Lithuanians in Polotsk! But it is impossible to persuade anyone to sacrifice
himself for his country. People either do this or do not. In thirteenth-century
Rus` according to the same Lay of Igor's Host, inertia (the egoism of laziness
and indifference) was added to dissension (the egoism of advantage), and these
disappeared only towards the end of the fourteenth century. Then Russia, reborn
like a phoenix in place of Rus` that had perished, rapidly took an upturn.</p>
<p>The same thing took place in the Near East where the Sunni,
Shi'ites, Qarmatians and Ismailites, as well as the Turks, Kurds, Arabs and
Persians had so weakened one another by mutual war that the small army of
Chormagan and Hulegu seized Iran and Iraq without great effort. It was not the
local inhabitants who halted the Mongols, but Baybars` Mamluks; the Kipchak
bought in the Crimean slave markets, i.e. the same steppe dwellers as the
Mongols themselves.</p>
<p>In China about eighty million industrious and well-to-do
people lived, and about a million poor nomads in the eastern Mongol ulus. It is
evident that without the deep internal disintegration of China, the causes of
which were mentioned above, the Mongols would not have been able to achieve
complete victory. The conquered were no less responsible for this than the
conquerors.</p>
<p>The brutality of the victorious Mongols was, of course,
terrible, but no less terrible were the bestialities of the Jurchen in China,
the Seljuks in Armenia, the Crusaders in the Baltic and in Byzantium. Such were
the times.</p>
<p>It is of interest to note that all four wars listed and a
fifth, the war against Southern China begun in 1237, i.e. ten years after
Chinggis-khan's death, were from the point of view of the Mongols themselves
blood vengeance, since in the thirteenth century the demoralised feudal lords
were accustomed to kill emissaries and this seemed to the artless Mongols to be
monstrous treachery. It was the killing of emissaries which served as the excuse
for the offensive <b><font COLOR="#943634">{373} </font></b>against the Chinese
Song Empire which fell by 1280. For the first time, the whole of China had been
conquered by foreigners.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the Mongol dynasty had taken the
Chinese name Yuan, used the Chinese language in administering the many millions
inhabiting the regions south of the Great Steppe, and even continued certain
traditions of Chinese external policy (the aspiration to conquer Indochina which
had begun in the Qin period, i.e. in the third century B.C.), the Mongols did
not fuse with the Chinese and failed to form a single people. They were
separated not only by the blood shed in battle, but also by a deep ethnic and
psychic difference, an active unwillingness to become similar to one another.</p>
<p>In the perspective we are concerned with, we should place the
Mongol Yuan Empire in a line with the Jurchen Qin and the Toba Wei. Even the
causes and nature of their fall are similar, which indicates a historical
pattern. The Mongol monarchs were obliged to maintain large military forces in
China <i>to </i>keep order there, and since these forces consisted of Mongols,
Kipchak, Alans and even Russians, constant military service was a heavy burden
on these peoples. The greater part of the male population of Mongolia served for
life in garrisons established in China. As a result, a movement of population to
the south took place and the northern regions of Mongolia became deserted. This
completely unavoidable process coincided with penetration by Russians into the
Far East.  <a name="sik5text91"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note91">[+91]</a> Ancient Rus`, contiguous with the Golden Horde, successfully
achieved mutual understanding and the establishment of frontiers by a series of
treaties equally beneficial to both sides: the Mongols left the Russians the
forest areas they did not need, the Russians agreed to provide the Mongol army
with volunteers who did not get on with the princes of the house of Rurik and
preferred a military career in the forces led by the baskaks. There the road was
open to wealth and rank.</p>
<p>Tanmachi or baskaks were officers of the Mongol army who were
commissioned to enlist men in the conquered country, to form a detachment and
fulfil the orders of the commanders.  <a name="sik5text92"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note92">[+92]</a> Obviously, the Mongol officer took only
volunteers because he was alone with his soldiers and, in the opposite case,
would immediately have been <b><font COLOR="#943634">{374} </font></b>killed.
The Mongols knew how to bind those who had voluntarily submitted to themselves.
Marco Polo explains it thus: &quot; ... the people seeing that the rule is good
and the king gracious willingly went to him&quot;.  <a name="sik5text93"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note93">[+93]</a> Perhaps for this, perhaps
for other reasons, the Mongols found enough people to complement their army in
all regions of their ulus. Berke-khan sent Russian soldiers to Kubilai's forces
 <a name="sik5text94"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note94">[+94]</a> but, of course, prior to their split in 1260. The exchange of subjects for
war service between sections of the Mongol empire also took place in the
fourteenth century. Ozbeg, khan of the Golden Horde, as a Chinggisid, had large
land holdings in China from which he drew income. But then he supplied soldiers
from his ulus, Russians and Yasy (Osetians), for the imperial guard in Beijing.
The &quot;Guard regiment of Russians famed for its fidelity&quot;  <a name="sik5text95"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note95">[+95]</a> was formed
there in 1330. The regiment was stationed north of Beijing and in peacetime the
military colonists supplied the emperor's table with game and fish.  <a name="sik5text96"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note96">[+96]</a> The
corps, called the &quot;As force&quot; in China, was distinguished by its skill
in riding and archery and defended the Yuan dynasty from Chinese rebels in 1350,
 <a name="sik5text97"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note97">[+97]</a> after which it is not mentioned. It seems the remnants of the Russians mixed
with the eastern Mongols and dissolved into them.</p>
<p>But who were those Russians who simply left their native land
and went to serve the conquerors? It would seem, given the town assembly <i>(veche)
</i>system of the northern towns and the constant intake into the retinues in
the southern principalities, that every energetic youth would find himself a
place in life. So it was, but not quite! Both in the towns and in the princes`
estates gold-domed Orthodox churches stood. Priests and monks strictly saw to it
that those granted the prince's trust did not participate in ritual games, did
not sacrifice to the wood spirits and did not engage in witchcraft. Apart from
that, they took account of attendance at services and observance of church
rituals so that the actual pagan, only reckoned to be baptised, could not rely
on moving up the ladder of service either with the prince or in the town.</p>
<p>But the Mongols were not concerned about one's confession of <b><font COLOR="#943634">{375}
</font></b>faith, except, of course, when someone of another faith took part in
politics which were controlled by communities which had formed in the Great
Steppe. There there were Nestorians, Buddhists, Muslims, but the
Orthodox-Russians, Osetians. baptised Polo vtsy - were obliged to stick to the
khan who fed and defended them. Therefore, they increased the extraterritorial
army of Kubilai and his heirs, conquered Southern China, Burma and Annam for
them, heroically, though unsuccessfully, fought in Japan and Java and ensured
the victory of the house of Yuan in the civil war against the Nestorian Mongol
princes Arik-Boke and Nayan.  <a name="sik5text98"></a><a href="sik5c.htm#sik5note98">[+98]</a> Probably, among tropical jungles they recalled
their native birch groves and steppes covered with fragrant wormwood, but return
to their homeland was difficult, long and, the main thing, without promise. A
distant land had swallowed up the newcomers and this freed the hands of the
bishops, abbots and princes who had avoided potential and still more terrible
competitors.</p>
<p>Yet the Mongol and German incursions into the Russian lands
(1231-42) had shown that the princes&quot; retinues and town levies were
inadequate to defend Orthodoxy. Of course, the talented <b><font COLOR="#943634">{376}
</font></b>commanders Aleksandr Nevskii and Daniil of Galich several times
severely defeated the Catholic knights, but one has to win wars, not battles.
But then historical fate came to the aid of Rus`.</p>
<p>The Nestorian party in East Asia suffered a final defeat and
its members could not count on the mercy of their furious enemy. They had to
save themselves! But where? Beyond the border they were hated as Mongols, in
Buddhist and Muslim regions as Christians, in Mongolia itself as rebels. It was
possible to hide from the khan's anger only among those of the same faith within
their state. That means in Rus`! They only had to avoid saying that they were
not Orthodox. No one would try to drag it out of them. So the departure for Rus`
of Tatar heroes began, men who from childhood had learnt to shoot at full gallop
from a taut longbow and to hack aslant from shoulder to waist with a light sabre.</p>
<p>Such specialists in military affairs were a godsend for the
princes and the church. They were welcomed with open arms, married fine ladies
and were immediately given posts in the forces. A Tatar reaching Moscow in
winter was granted a fur coat, if he arrived in summer a princely title. One
could trust them without worry. Their retreat was cut off, especially after 1312
when Ozbeg introduced Islam into the Golden Horde and executed all those
refusing to betray the faith of their fathers. No contacts could arise between
the newcomers and popular movements. The West was to them as alien as China had
been in Asia.</p>
<p>And the Golden Horde? It began to grow weak, for it had sent
from its orbit its best fighters and loyal subjects. Ozbeg, in accepting Islam,
converted his headquarters into a capital of merchants and began to rely on the
population of the Volga towns to whom the name &quot;Tatar&quot; was attached.
The steppe dwellers in the east began to be called Kazakhs, and those in the
west Nogai. Both, by the very force of circumstances, were in opposition to the
central government which changed from a khanate into a commonplace Muslim
sultanate. The inertia of former greatness helped the energetic rulers Ozbeg and
Janibeg maintain the system for a certain time, but in 1357 Janibeg perished at
the hands of his own son, Berdibeg, and the &quot;great revolution&quot; began,
a rapid leapfrogging of khans elevated to the throne and thereupon killed which
resulted in the temnik Mamai, not a Chinggisid, becoming the actual head of the
Golden Horde. He headed the western uluses.</p>
<p>Mamai was an intelligent politician. He understood that
without <b><font COLOR="#943634">{377} </font></b>allies and a rear it was
impossible to create a firm situation. The Chinggisids and their supporters were
his natural enemies, but the Orthodox church which headed Russian social opinion
in the fourteenth century stood on the side of the overthrown but legal dynasty.
In the Crimea the Genoese needed Mamai's friendship for unhindered trade in
Eastern Europe. They had money, and behind them stood the growing might of
Catholic Western Europe. Mamai changed the traditional policy of the Horde in
protecting the Russian lands from the advance of Catholicism and concluded an
alliance with the Lithuanian prince Jagailo and the Genoese in the Crimea.
Dmitrii Donskoi's victory at the battle of Kulikovo, unexpected by the whole
world, delayed the Lithuanians&quot; decisive offensive against Moscow; and
Edigei's victory over Vitovt on the Vorskla in 1399 confirmed the success. It
enabled the Moscow princes to mount a counter-offensive against the threat from
the west which was much more dangerous than the clashes with the Volga and Don
nomads, who had finally lost any trace of unity.</p>
<p>Of course, relations between Russians and Turks in the
thirteenth to sixteenth centuries were not unclouded, but this was unavoidable
in a period of feudal dismemberment. Did inter-princely strife, for example, the
enmity between Moscow and Tver&quot;, really produce less harm than the quarrels
with the steppe tribes, for example, the Nogais and the Tatars of the Horde?
These were, however, disagreements within a single system, a single culture, a
single country. And had it been otherwise, would Russian travellers really have
been able to pass with their insignificant forces across the enormous expanse of
Siberia and the Far East?</p>
<p>
</p>
<h4>A Few Words to the Reader</h4>
<p>Now, probably, the attentive reader regards the book and its
author with astonishment. Well, who behaves like that, putting forward a well
thought out construction as an aphorism? It's simply uneconomic! Would not it be
better to write three monographs instead of three &quot;attempts&quot;, to
supply them with an apparatus of references, notes, tables and to crown oneself
with the laurels of bibliographic erudition? And the main thing, now that the
guiding thought has been formulated, is that one only needs a little assiduity
and blank paper.</p>
<p>True, but then the basic idea for the sake of which this
small book <b><font COLOR="#943634">{378} </font></b>has been written would be
lost. The author has striven to show that understanding events and accumulating
them are different things. The moment of enlightenment does not precede studying
the problem and does not crown it, but lies somewhere in the middle, a bit
nearer the beginning. If no sparks have been struck between the scholar and his
material, there can be no synthesis. Searches in the proper sense of the word
start later, for it is only worthwhile searching when you know what you are
looking for. Usually the creative factor is concealed - it is much quieter so,
and the author leads the reader from the known to the unknown new matter by a
selection of quotations from ancient sources and a strictly logical argument.
This is the way I, too, have proceeded till now; but this time, as I finished my
&quot;steppe trilogy&quot;, I wanted to disclose the &quot;trade secret&quot;,
because in this book more attention has been given, not to a legendary kingdom
that never existed, but to the means of understanding a fine branch of knowledge
- history.</p>

<p><a name="sik5note98"></A><A HREF="sik5c.htm#sik5text98">[+98]</a> John of Marignolli, legate of Pope Benedict XII, met
these people in the Yuan empire when he was in Khanbalik from 1342 to 1346 With
khan Tokalmut (Chinese Shun-di) He was the last papal emissary who crossed the
Gobi in those times and visited the last &quot;Great Kaan&quot;, who received
him very kindly Marignolli writes that &quot;the Alans rule the eastern lands of
the empire [and there were more than thirty thousand of these Alans - L.G.],
Christians, both true [Catholics - L.<i>G.</i>] and only nominally so [Orthodox
and Nestorians - L.G.], and they call themselves slaves of the pope and are
ready to give their lives for the Franks&quot; (Ya in Svet, <i>Posle Marko Polo,
in </i>, 1968, 196) Yet they refused to lay down their lives for their khan and
on encountering the forces of the Chinese rebels in 1351 they turned the rear
Evidently life in a strange land surrounded by hostile native inhabitants did
not have a favourable influence on their military prowess But this change in
their ethnic character and the stereotype of their conduct could not arise
merely as a result of circumstances. We know many isolated ethni who remained
stable even in less favourable conditions But here the split among the &quot;Alans&quot;
themselves, which was effected by Montecorvino's activities must have weakened
their resistance to the influence of their environment R. Khennig <i>(Nevedomye
zemli, </i>in, 232) shows unconcealed lack of respect of Marignolli's
information He notes that the latter chatters a lot about minor matters, but
leaves out what is important But it is this lack of critical perception by the
papal legate that is useful for us, since his naive bias cannot contuse the
contemporary historian Even the scant information he gives us about the
Christians in the Yuan empire shows that it was the stab in the back by
Montecorvino which had deprived the Far Eastern Christian community of viability
and made it defenceless before Buddhism and Islam which, at the end of the
fourteenth century, divided the Nestorian inheritance.</p>
