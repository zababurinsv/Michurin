<h1 align="center">THE HISTORY OF THE KHAZARS</h1>

<h2 align="center"><b>Summary</b></h2>

<h3 align="right">М. И. Артамонов</h3>

<h4 align="center">Под редакцией и с примечаниями Л.
Н. Гумилёва</h4>

<p>The work of M. I. Artamonov is the first sequential account known in Soviet
historical publications ≈ of
the history of the southern part of eastern Europe from the IVth to the XIth
centuries, the main matter of the book being the history of the Khazars and
their state, which had existed a little less than 300 years. Many points of the Khazar history have been either
dealt with for the first time or shown in a new light on the basis of the
author's original investigations. These investigations have been made not only
on the scanty materials found in Byzantine, Armenian, Arabic and other authors,
but also on the archaeological finds of the Khazar period brought to light by
the author himself and stored at present, in the State Hermitage. Of great
importance among them are the excavation material of Sarkil or Biela Viezha, a
border fortress of the Khazar period, and later a Russian town, situated in the
lower course of the Don on the way from Tmutorokan to the lower Volga.</p>
<p>A wide reference to archaeological data, for purposes of interpreting the
history of the Khazars, resorted to in the book, not only distinguishes it from
other works on the same subject, but also enables the author ≈ a qualified archaeologist
≈ to deal with problems that none of his prede╜cessors
could have either set or dealt with.</p>
<p>The Hun invasion marked a new period in the history of eastern Europe. An
important ethnic reconstruction of the tribes had been taking place in the
southern regions of the country since that time. The control of the territory
passed from the Iranian to Turkic speaking tribes con╜sisting of the Tiurkized
Ugrs from western Siberia and the remains of the Sormat-Alans assimilated by the
invaders from central Asia. Temporary military powers rose and fell amidst these
tribes whose patriarchal clan</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">{517}</font></p>
<p>system was complicated by the developed economic inequality and slavery.
Byzantium and the Sassanian Iran made use of these military powers in their
endless wars. The Akatzirs, the Sabirs, the Saragurs, the Onogurs, the Utigurs,
the Kutrigurs, and, at last, the Avars rose to the stage of history and passed
away one after another. It was only the Avars who succeeded in the second half
of the Vlth century ≈ by
subjugating the Slav population ≈ to found a relatively permanent state in central Europe
and, for some time, to exercise control over the tribes of Kutrigurs on the
northern shores of the Black Sea. At the same time a vast but≈ as had been the case with most of the nomad states
≈ short-lived empire, the Turkut Khaganate, extended its
power over the steppes farther east of the Don.</p>
<p>The Turkut empire disintegrated after 100 years of existence, torn apart by internecine civil wars;
and new kingdoms≈-the
Khazar and the Bulgar ≈ arose
on its ruins in eastern Europe. The fierce struggle of these two states very
soon ended in the expulsion of the Bulgars beyond the Danube, and the rise of
the powerful Khazar empire, extending its power over the southern part of
eastern Europe. At the head of the Khazar state stood an old Turkut dynasty, and
the Khazars, who nomadised in the eastern coastal lands of the Caspian between
the courses of the Volga and the Terek, constituted the core of the state. The
nearest neighbours of the Khazars were the Bulgars of the Kuban river valley and
the Sabirs of northern Dagestan who were under the Khazar supremacy. The Sabirs
are also known as Huns. They were beginning to profess Christianity, while Jews
penetrated into Khazaria from Iran.</p>
<p>The Khazar state at the point of its flourishing checked the advance of nomad
hordes from Asia creating conditions for colonization not only of the wooded
steppe belt, but also, partially, of the steppes themselves. In the VIIIth
century, the process of settled cultivation in the steppes, closely connected
with intensive social and economic differentiation, takes place among some of
the nomad tribes. In the country of the Don and the Donets, in northern Caucasus,
and in eastern Crimea appear many agricultural settlements and castles protected
by stone walls. Trades begin to develop, old towns on the shores of the Black
Sea come back to life and new ones spring up in northern Caucasus and the lower
Volga. Khazaria was the first feudal state in eastern Europe, which ranged
together with the Byzan╜tine Empire and the Arab Caliphate. It boldly
interfered in the interna╜tional affairs of its time and laid claim to the
territories of eastern Trans╜caucasia. In Transcaucasia the Khazars met another
aggressive nation ≈ the
Arabs, and a close alliance was formed between Byzantium and Kha╜zaria in face
of the common enemy. It was only due to the powerful Khazar attacks, diverting
the tide of the Arab armies to the Caucasus, that Byzantium withstood against
them. Inspite of the fact that as a result of a continuous war, lasting for
three decades, and apparently terminating in a glorious victory of the Arabs
over the Khazars ≈ their
Khagan being forced to turn Muslim in 737
≈ the Khazars exhausted the resources of the Arabs made
them stop in the Caucasus, and checked their further progress</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">{518}</font></p>
<p>into Eastern Europe. The Arabs were forced to send a request for terms
seeking an alliance with the Khazars, while the tribes of Transcaucasia looked
hopefully to Khazar assistance in their struggle for independence.</p>
<p>Byzantium appreciated friendly relations with the Khazars and tried to
strengthen the alliance by all means, intermarriages of the ruling dynasties
including. In, the 80s of
the Vlllth century Byzantium did not support the Goth uprising in the Crimea
against the Khazars, though it tried to strengthen its own influence in Khazaria
by means of uniting the Khazar Christians into a dependent religious body, the
so-called Gothic Eparchy, controled by Byzantium.</p>
<p>The conversion of the Khazar Khagan and his attendants to Judaism thus
promoting Judaism to a position of state religion is a phenomenon unprecedented
in the history of the Middle Ages. Judaism had been adopted by a Khazar prince
in northern Dagestan as early as the 30s of the Vlllth century, but the fact
didn't affect the inner life of the Khazar kingdom, and the Khazar population
continued to enjoy full liberty of religion for all professing Christianity,
Islam or even worshipping their old Turkic god Tengri-khan. At the openning of
the IXth century, however, the Jewish Khazars grew in importance at the Khazar's
court, seized power and insti╜tuted the double kingship, reducing the Khagan,
the descendant of the Turkut dynasty, to a position of a sacred king set aside
from state power. A political and religious coup d'etat carried through by
Obadiah, founder of the Jewish Khazar king dynasty, was followed by religious
persecution of Christians and Muslims resulting, in particular, in the abolition
of the Gothic Province church unity of the Christian Khazars rather numerous in
the Crimea and northern Caucasus. An uprising against the usurper, followed by a
long civil war in Khazaria, brought about its decline, and opened the way to the
Madyars (Hungarians) into Europe; then came the Pechenegs, who appeared for the
first time on the stage of history.</p>
<p>The few Khazars remaining after the unsuccessful uprising and sur╜viving the
sanguinary civil wars became known as ╚Khabars╩; they joined the Madyars and
settled together with them in Atelkuza, the country bet╜ween the two rivers ≈
the Dnieper and the Donets. The Khazar Khagan tried to use
the Madyars as allies in his wars against the Pechenegs. He helped them to
institute kingship under his protection, but failed in his attempts. The Madyar
state had but a short life, and the end of the IXth century saw the Madyars give
way under heavy attacks of the Pechenegs and Bulgars and migrate to the regions
of the present-day Hungaria. The Pechenegs remaining the sole possessors of the
steppes north of the Black Sea, the inner lands of Khazaria turned into hostile
provinces.</p>
<p>Slav tribes inhabiting the country along the river Dnieper took the
opportunity to throw the Khazar yoke and in the IXth century laid the foundation
of an independent state of their own which began to expand and consolidate in
the struggle with the Khazars and other enemies.</p>
<p>By this time, the whole economic structure of the Khazar state had
considerably changed. A typically military empire of former days whose main
concern was warfare and plunder, the Khazar empire of Jewish ru-</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">{519}</font></p>
<p>lers turned to trading, profiting by its favorable geographical position
across important trade-routes of Asia and Europe and also between the south and
the north. Custom-dues and tithes on merchandise coming along these routes
became the source of the king's income and means for sup╜porting his
magnificent court and paid army, which alone could secure him temporary power
over the agglomeration of diversified and economi╜cally disconnected tribes,
longing for independence, but still remaining in the Khazar state. Deprived of
territories and distrusted by the population, the weakened Khazar authority
existed now only by force of arms of the paid troops.</p>
<p>After the conversion of the Khazars to Judaism, Byzantium continued to
maintain friendly relations with Khazaria for some time and even assi╜sted in 834
in building Sarkil, a fortress on the Don. Constantino's (Syril)
mission resulted in the restoration of some local churches in Khazar re╜gions,
but they never became united in anything like the abolished Gothic Eparchy.
Eventually with the eclipse of the military glory of the Khazars the attitude of
Byzantium underwent a quick change. In the first half of the Xth century,
Byzantium organized a number of unsuccessful raids against the Khazars by their
neighbours: the Ghuzz, the Pechenegs, the Asies, and the Alans. Khazaria found
strength enough to defeat the intru╜ders, but shortly afterwards, in the year 913/4
and 943/4, strong Russian-Varangian hired bodies of men at arms,
dismissed by Russian princes, crossed the Khazar lands on their plunder
expedition to the Caspian coast, the Khazars being unable to put up resistance.</p>
<p>The center of the Khazar empire of the IXth≈Xth
centuries was the town of Atil situated on both banks of the Volga, later,
Saray-i-Butu, the first capital of the Gold Horde, was built on its site. The
eastern part of the town was inhabited by merchants and craftsmen from different
countries, the western ≈ was
reserved for the pure-bred Khazars, and king's paid body-guard consisting
chiefly of Muslims. The Khazars remained during the winter in town. In spring
they went out to the steppes and stayed there till autumn pasturing flocks.
Lands formally assigned to separate clans were in fact in feudal possession of
the clan and military aristocracy with all the consequent duties paid to them by
the actual pro╜ducers. Some of the lands were cultivated and yielded crop which
was taken to town in autumn.</p>
<p>The important position of Khazaria in international trade relations and the
diversified pattern of the population of its capital caused the Jewish Khazars
to turn from previous religious intoleration to full liberty of va╜rious creeds
for all. Especially as Judaism was essentially non-prosely-tic, and remained the
religion of the ruling class only, which rather sepa╜rated than contributed to
the unity of the Khazar population, other reli╜gions being extensively
practiced, old Turkic paganism being particularly popular. Hebrew learning
flourished only at the king's court but there it led to the appearance of
historical works such as local geneologies and chronicles. The wide sections of
Turkic speaking populace of Khazaria used Tiurk runic letters. The Khazars
didn't create any material culture</p>
<p><font color="#C0C0C0">{520}</font></p>
<p>of their own but developed old Sarmat-Alan traditions supplemented with some
borrowings from Central Asia and Iran-Arab East. The Khazars and Bulgars
differed very little ethnographically and are supposed to have been descendants
of the Alans remaining in Central Caucasus and along the northern outskirts of
the steppes between the Don and the Donets. The Madyars brought the elements of
the same culture to Hungary. Other Turkic speaking nomads who invaded Europe,
beginning with the Peche╜negs, belonged to a different ethnographical type
reminding more of a standard formed in Central Asia of the Khaganate period.</p>
<p>The downfall of Khazaria was the consequence of defeats inflicted by the
Russians who joined forces against the Khazars with the Ghuzz, ho╜stile tribes
from the regions beyond the Volga. The Russian state claimed to inherit
predominance of the Khazars in the East-European steppes, as well as to capture
control of eastern trade-routes and trade, which had so much enriched the
Khazars and in which the Russians themselves acti╜vely participated. In
consequence of Sviatoslav and Vladimir's expedi╜tions down the Volga nearly all
Khazar territories.were lost to the Russians inspite of the interference of
Khwarizm, whose assistance the Khazars secured adopting Islam. Only Bulgaria on
the Volga remained indepen╜dent and continued to control the middle Volga
water-way. In this connec╜tion the important role of the Russian principality
of Tmutorokan becomes evident. It exercised strong political influence over all
the lands of south╜east including the strait of Kcrtch, the country of Kuban
river, the lower Povolzye, and the lower Podonye and secured for the Russians
free trade with the East. In the beginning of the XIIth century the Russian
State was forced, under the stress of feudal strife, to retreat before the
invasion of the new nomad horde ≈ the Komans ≈ and lose the remains of the Khazar heritage. The mastery
of the steppes passed to the Komans, and any traces of the Khazars and other
Turkic speaking tribes vanished among them.</p>
<p>The book gives not only a pragmatic account of the history of the sou╜thern
part of eastern Europe of the IVth≈XIth
centuries, but also throws light on general laws of historical development, and
on many particular points which are of importance for the history of some
peoples and terri╜tories constituting once the Khazar kingdom, such as for
instance the Goths of the Crimea, the Hun-Sabirs of northern Dagestan, the Black
Bulgars of the Kuban river, the Alans, the Asies and many others. The book deals
also with the important role of the West-Turkut Khaganate in the history of
eastern Europe.</p>
<p>The notes of L. N. Gumilev,
the editor of the book, contain valuable additions and new standpoints relating
to the historical event of Eurasia which expand and enrich the account of the
author. The book is intended not only for historians, but also for
nonspecialists possessing elementary historical knowledge. The table of contents
gives the plan upon which the book has been constructed.</p>
